Glucose hypometabolism and glial activation are pathological features seen in AD brains; however, the connection between the two is not fully understood. Using a Drosophila model of AD, we identified that glucose metabolism in glia plays a critical role in neuroinflammation under disease conditions. Expression of human tau in the retinal cells, including photoreceptor neurons and pigment glia, causes photoreceptor degeneration accompanied by inclusion formation and swelling of lamina glial cells. We found that inclusions are formed by glial phagocytosis, and swelling of the laminal cortex correlates with the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Co-expression of human glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) with tau in the retina does not affect tau levels but suppresses these inflammatory responses and photoreceptor degeneration. We also found that expression of GLUT3, specifically in the pigment glia, is sufficient to suppress inflammatory phenotypes and mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in the tau-expressing retina. Our results suggest that glial glucose metabolism contributes to inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in tauopathy.",NA,"biorxiv",19955,FALSE

The extent to which these traits are correlated can elucidate their function as either redundant or multiple messages. Using the agamid lizard, Psammophilus dorsalis, as a model system we examined patterns of trait expression and the role of steroid hormones in mediating these traits during social interactions. We staged male-male interactions in the lab and measured the repertoire of display behaviour and colours, which change dynamically in the visible and ultraviolet ranges in different body regions. Additionally, we measured testosterone and corticosterone levels before and after the social trials. Our results show that within behaviour and colour trait categories, components were strongly correlated within individuals, suggesting either a shared physiological pathway or redundant information content. However, across trait categories, correlation patterns varied. The chromatic contrast of the (yellow) dorsal region of lizards was correlated with both body size and level of aggression, whereas the size of UV patches was correlated with body size only. We also found a negative association between baseline corticosterone levels, body size and dorsal yellow chromatic contrast, suggesting a mechanistic link between these traits. However, social interaction induced testosterone and corticosterone levels were uncorrelated with the expression of the dynamic behavioural and colour displays during the social interactions itself. Notably, the intensity of colour and behavioural displays of males were matched by their opponents. Overall, our results suggest that multiple signalling traits can ensure both redundancy as well as provide multiple messages to receivers, thus improving the robustness of information transfer, particularly during competitions which have high fitness consequences.",NA,"biorxiv",19955,FALSE

However, the nature of the interaction between these two traits is poorly understood. We hypothesise that pigmentation patterns could be linked to the behavioural repertoires underlying social status and can be resolved to regions on the cichlid body plan. To test this hypothesis, we generated Territorial (T) and Non-territorial (NT) males and employed computer vision tools to quantify and visualise patterns/colour enrichment associated with stereotyped T/NT male behaviour. We report colour-behaviour interactions localised in specific areas of the body and face for two colour morphs, illustrating a more nuanced view of social behaviour and pigmentation.

UV sensitivity and UV colour signals are essential for feeding and form the basis for a secret communication channel invisible to the many UV-blind predatory fish on the reef; however, how these traits develop across ontogenetic stages, and their distribution across the damselfish family is poorly characterised. Here, we used UV photography, phylogenetic reconstructions of opsin genes, differential gene expression analysis (DGE) of retinal samples, to investigate the development of UV vision and colour patterns in three ontogenetic stages (pre-settlement larval, juvenile, and adult) of eleven damselfish species. Using DGE, we found similar gene expression between juveniles and adults, which strongly differed from larvae. All species and all stages expressed at least one UV-sensitive sws1 opsin gene. However, UV body colour patterns only started to appear at the juvenile stage. Moreover, Pomacentrus species displayed highly complex UV body patterns that were correlated with the expression of two sws1 copies. This could mean that some damselfishes can discriminate colours that change only in their UV component. We demonstrate dramatic shifts in both UV sensitivity and UV colouration across the development stages of damselfish, while highlighting the importance of considering ontogeny when studying the coevolution of visual systems and colour signals.",NA,"biorxiv",19959,FALSE

Analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of CT-type signaling has revealed the occurrence of CT-type peptides and CTR/CLR-type proteins in deuterostome and protostome invertebrates. Furthermore, experimental studies have revealed that in the protostome Drosophila melanogaster the CT-like peptide DH31 can act as a ligand for a CTR/CLR-type receptor and a pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) receptor. Here we investigated the signaling mechanisms and functions of CT-type neuropeptides in a deuterostome invertebrate, the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (phylum Echinodermata). In A. japonicus, a single gene encodes two CT-type peptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2), both of which act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor (AjCTR) and two PDF-type receptors (AjPDFR1, AjPDFR2), but with differential activation of downstream cAMP/PKA, Gq/Ca2+/PKC and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Analysis of the expression of the gene encoding AjCT1 and AjCT2 revealed transcripts in a variety of organ systems, but with highest expression in the circumoral nervous system. In vitro pharmacological experiments revealed that AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 cause dose-dependent relaxation of longitudinal body wall muscle and intestine preparations. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacological experiments and loss-of-function tests revealed a potential physiological role for AjCT2 signaling in promoting feeding and growth in A. japonicus. This is the first study to obtain evidence that CT-type peptides can act as ligands for both CTR/CLR-type and PDF-type receptors in a deuterostome.

However, whether these relationships influence attention remains unclear. Additionally, whether facial expressions affect selective attention is unknown; for example, reddish angry faces increase negative social evaluation or emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether selective attention is similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 amplitudes for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, there was no significant main effect or interaction effect of facial expression or facial color on P1 amplitudes for the target, and there were significant main effects of facial expression only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the intensity of a human's selective attention to facial expressions varies according to the higher-order semantic processing of the relationship between emotion and color rather than simple facial expression or facial color effects individually.

Using an automated behavioral tracking system, we also report that mosquitoes exhibit daily modulation of response persistence to the host cue carbon dioxide and loss of PDF alters this pattern.

Being the most species-rich lineage in the magnoliids, Annonaceae are a major flowering plant component of tropical rainforests, and are important in the plant-pollinator network of this biome. Insects such as beetles, flies, bees, cockroaches and thrips have been reported as their pollinators. Although there has been considerable effort to assess their interactions with pollinators, attempts to characterise the visual and olfactory communication channels between them are scarce. Here, we report the floral phenology and characterise the spectral reflectance and odour of 12 Annonaceae species from five genera, viz. Meiogyne, Monoon, Polyalthia, Pseuduvaria, and Uvaria. Pseuduvaria species are either monoecious or dioecious while the four genera produce hermaphroditic flowers. The Meiogyne species are likely pollinated by small beetles; the Polyalthia and Pseuduvaria species are likely pollinated by both beetles and flies; and the Uvaria species is likely pollinated by both beetles and bees. All species produce flowers that are not reflective in the 300-350 nm UV spectrum, and have various spectral reflectance profile across the remaining UV and visible spectra. We detected diverse floral volatiles across all the species assessed. The flowers of the small beetle-pollinated species, including Meiogyne species and Polyalthia xanthocarpa, emitted mostly branched-chain esters, including isobutyl acetate and isoamyl acetate. The Pseuduvaria species emitted scent reminiscent of rotten fruit, largely consisting of 2,3-butanediol, a common by-product in yeast fermentation. The flowers of Uvaria concava, which were visited by both bees and beetles, released mainly straight-chain esters, including methyl hexanoate and methyl (Z)-4-octenoate. A corrugated inner petal outgrowth was observed in Meiogyne and Pseuduvaria; this functions as a food body reward in Meiogyne, but as a nectary gland for Pseuduvaria.

Pollinators often show a positive frequency-dependent foraging which confers reproductive advantage to common morphs over rare morphs. However, pollinator-mediated selections often act on visual floral displays. Here, we investigate hawkmoth-mediated selection in a nocturnal Curcuma caulina (Zingiberaceae) with bract colour polymorphism, where the role of visual display is minimal. We used path analyses to explain maintenance of differential morph abundances in C. caulina. For this, we quantified inter-morph trait variations in floral structures, nectar traits, pollinator visitations, physiological compatibilities and reproductive fitness. We noted that the rarest morph was self-compatible, exhibited higher nectar reward and pollinator visits, and low reproductive fitness, whereas the two common morphs were complete to partially self-incompatible, with lower nectar rewards and pollinator visits, but higher reproductive fitness. We conclude that while hawkmoths show a positive response to floral rewards, self-compatibility confers lower reproductive fitness to the nectar-rich rare morphs. In contrast, self-incompatibility confers higher fitness to the common morphs despite lower pollinator visits. Thus, colour polymorphism in nocturnal C. caulina is explained by floral traits associated with bract colour, which are under pollinator-mediated selection.",NA,"biorxiv",19991,FALSE

Phytoplankton 18S rRNA sequences were sampled over a one-month period in surface seawater and within bulk-collected and individually-isolated sinking particles using mesopelagic sediment traps (100-500m). Nearly all phytoplankton amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) exported from the surface were packaged in large (>300 m) particles. Individually, these particles contained only a few distinct phytoplankton ASVs, but collectively, large particles transported about half of the surface taxonomic diversity into the mesopelagic. The relative sequence abundances of the surface community detected within particles were quantitatively related to measured POC fluxes: a linear model based on the relative sequence abundance of just two pigment-based phytoplankton taxa, diatoms and photosynthetic Hacrobia, was predictive of POC flux magnitude. These two taxa were also enriched within the ecologically-distinct particle classes that had the greatest influence on carbon export magnitude.

Pigment was extracted by solvent extraction method and the best solvent was selected based on its ability to dissolve the culture suspension. The pigment was characterized using spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. Culture agitation rate, initial medium pH and concentration of yeast extract were identified as the most significant (p< 0.0001) variables affecting pigment production. At optimized conditions, 0.96 g/L of pigment was extracted from 4.73 g/L of culture biomass and the extracted pigment under optimized conditions was 1.6 times higher than the pigment extracted under un-optimized conditions. The spectroscopic and chromatographic analyses demonstrated the presence of different functional groups and carotenoids were identified as parts of the molecule responsible for the yellowish-orange pigmentation of the extract. This study demonstrated the potential for optimization of pigment production by bacteria using agro-waste extract as substrate. Hence, the current findings strongly encourage for further study at a large-scale level for industrial production.","NA","biorxiv",20014,FALSE
