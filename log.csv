In homeostasis, this mechanical status can be summarised as mechanical homeostasis, regulated by the balance of intercellular tension and extracellular matrix adhesion forces. In the outer retina, the significance of this force balance and its consequences for vision remains poorly understood. We found that the density of basement membrane laminins modulates the level of retinal pigmented epithelium contractility, which directly controls its efficiency in phagocytosing photoreceptor outer segments. In vivo, the density gradient of laminins follows retinal functional demand, supporting the physiological role of laminins in controlling epithelial mechanical homeostasis. Our data suggest that laminin density and isoform heterogeneity can differentially engage integrins {beta}1 and {beta}4, the ratio of which determines the contribution of actin vs keratin cytoskeleton in balancing tissue mechanics. With this work, we suggest that the extracellular matrix-defined mechanical status of retinal pigmented epithelium is a novel parameter for visual function.

SignificanceIn the retina, the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is responsible for the daily phagocytosis of photoreceptor cell fragments, a process vital for visual function. Along the visual axis, there is a natural decrease in the ratio of photoreceptors to RPE cells, indicating a decrease in RPE functional demand. This study reveals that the density of laminins in RPE basement membrane also diminishes along this axis, critically influencing RPE function by regulating its contractility. For the first time, we demonstrate the presence of a laminin- defined mechanical gradient within the RPE, which determines its capacity to support photoreceptor cells. Our findings highlight the importance of mechanical properties as a key factor in visual function, offering new insights into retinal health and disease.",NA,"biorxiv","2024-08-15"

Glucose hypometabolism and glial activation are pathological features seen in AD brains; however, the connection between the two is not fully understood. Using a Drosophila model of AD, we identified that glucose metabolism in glia plays a critical role in neuroinflammation under disease conditions. Expression of human tau in the retinal cells, including photoreceptor neurons and pigment glia, causes photoreceptor degeneration accompanied by inclusion formation and swelling of lamina glial cells. We found that inclusions are formed by glial phagocytosis, and swelling of the laminal cortex correlates with the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Co-expression of human glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) with tau in the retina does not affect tau levels but suppresses these inflammatory responses and photoreceptor degeneration. We also found that expression of GLUT3, specifically in the pigment glia, is sufficient to suppress inflammatory phenotypes and mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in the tau-expressing retina. Our results suggest that glial glucose metabolism contributes to inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in tauopathy.",NA,"biorxiv","19955"

The extent to which these traits are correlated can elucidate their function as either redundant or multiple messages. Using the agamid lizard, Psammophilus dorsalis, as a model system we examined patterns of trait expression and the role of steroid hormones in mediating these traits during social interactions. We staged male-male interactions in the lab and measured the repertoire of display behaviour and colours, which change dynamically in the visible and ultraviolet ranges in different body regions. Additionally, we measured testosterone and corticosterone levels before and after the social trials. Our results show that within behaviour and colour trait categories, components were strongly correlated within individuals, suggesting either a shared physiological pathway or redundant information content. However, across trait categories, correlation patterns varied. The chromatic contrast of the (yellow) dorsal region of lizards was correlated with both body size and level of aggression, whereas the size of UV patches was correlated with body size only. We also found a negative association between baseline corticosterone levels, body size and dorsal yellow chromatic contrast, suggesting a mechanistic link between these traits. However, social interaction induced testosterone and corticosterone levels were uncorrelated with the expression of the dynamic behavioural and colour displays during the social interactions itself. Notably, the intensity of colour and behavioural displays of males were matched by their opponents. Overall, our results suggest that multiple signalling traits can ensure both redundancy as well as provide multiple messages to receivers, thus improving the robustness of information transfer, particularly during competitions which have high fitness consequences.",NA,"biorxiv","19955"

Social status and animal colouration are covarying traits that are plastic in response to dynamic environments. In the African cichlid, Astatotilapia burtoni, body colouration and behaviour have been extensively reported to vary with social rank. However, the nature of the interaction between these two traits is poorly understood. We hypothesise that pigmentation patterns could be linked to the behavioural repertoires underlying social status and can be resolved to regions on the cichlid body plan. To test this hypothesis, we generated Territorial (T) and Non-territorial (NT) males and employed computer vision tools to quantify and visualise patterns/colour enrichment associated with stereotyped T/NT male behaviour. We report colour-behaviour interactions localised in specific areas of the body and face for two colour morphs, illustrating a more nuanced view of social behaviour and pigmentation. Since behavioural and morphological variation are key drivers of selection in the East African Great Rift Lakes, we surmise our data may be translatable to other cichlid lineages and underline the importance of trait covariance in sexual selection and male competition.",NA,"biorxiv","19958"

They exhibit diverse body colouration within and between the ~250 species and across ontogenetic stages. In addition to human visible colours (i.e., 400-700 nm), most adult damselfishes reflect ultraviolet (UV, 300-400 nm) colour patches. UV sensitivity and UV colour signals are essential for feeding and form the basis for a secret communication channel invisible to the many UV-blind predatory fish on the reef; however, how these traits develop across ontogenetic stages, and their distribution across the damselfish family is poorly characterised. Here, we used UV photography, phylogenetic reconstructions of opsin genes, differential gene expression analysis (DGE) of retinal samples, to investigate the development of UV vision and colour patterns in three ontogenetic stages (pre-settlement larval, juvenile, and adult) of eleven damselfish species. Using DGE, we found similar gene expression between juveniles and adults, which strongly differed from larvae. All species and all stages expressed at least one UV-sensitive sws1 opsin gene. However, UV body colour patterns only started to appear at the juvenile stage. Moreover, Pomacentrus species displayed highly complex UV body patterns that were correlated with the expression of two sws1 copies. This could mean that some damselfishes can discriminate colours that change only in their UV component. We demonstrate dramatic shifts in both UV sensitivity and UV colouration across the development stages of damselfish, while highlighting the importance of considering ontogeny when studying the coevolution of visual systems and colour signals.",NA,"biorxiv","19959"

Analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of CT-type signaling has revealed the occurrence of CT-type peptides and CTR/CLR-type proteins in deuterostome and protostome invertebrates. Furthermore, experimental studies have revealed that in the protostome Drosophila melanogaster the CT-like peptide DH31 can act as a ligand for a CTR/CLR-type receptor and a pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) receptor. Here we investigated the signaling mechanisms and functions of CT-type neuropeptides in a deuterostome invertebrate, the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (phylum Echinodermata). In A. japonicus, a single gene encodes two CT-type peptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2), both of which act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor (AjCTR) and two PDF-type receptors (AjPDFR1, AjPDFR2), but with differential activation of downstream cAMP/PKA, Gq/Ca2+/PKC and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Analysis of the expression of the gene encoding AjCT1 and AjCT2 revealed transcripts in a variety of organ systems, but with highest expression in the circumoral nervous system. In vitro pharmacological experiments revealed that AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 cause dose-dependent relaxation of longitudinal body wall muscle and intestine preparations. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacological experiments and loss-of-function tests revealed a potential physiological role for AjCT2 signaling in promoting feeding and growth in A. japonicus. This is the first study to obtain evidence that CT-type peptides can act as ligands for both CTR/CLR-type and PDF-type receptors in a deuterostome. Furthermore, because of the economic importance of A. japonicus as a foodstuff, discovery of the potential role for CT-type peptides as regulators of feeding and growth in this species may provide a basis for practical applications in aquaculture.",NA,"biorxiv","19966"

Chromatin exhibits a hierarchical organization with structural compartments and domains at different length scales, from nanometers to micrometers. Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) methods, such as STORM, are essential for studying chromatin at the supra-nucleosome level due to their ability to target epigenetic marks that determine chromatin organization. Multi-label imaging of chromatin is necessary to unpack its structural complexity. However, these efforts are challenged by the high-density nuclear environment, which can affect antibody binding affinities, diffusivity and non-specific interactions. Optimizing buffer conditions, fluorophore stability, and antibody specificity is crucial for achieving effective antibody conjugates. Here, we demonstrate a sequential immunolabeling protocol that reliably enables three-label studies within the dense nuclear environment. This protocol couples multiplexed localization datasets with a robust analysis algorithm, which utilizes localizations from one target as seed points for distance, density and multi-label joint affinity measurements to explore complex organization of all three targets. Applying this multi-plexed algorithm to analyze distance and joint density reveals that heterochromatin and euchromatin are not-distinct territories, but that localization of transcription and euchromatin couple with the periphery of heterochromatic clusters. This work is a crucial step in molecular imaging of the dense nuclear environment as multi-label capacity enables for investigation of complex multi-component systems like chromatin with enhanced accuracy.","NA","biorxiv","19980"
