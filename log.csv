In homeostasis, this mechanical status can be summarised as mechanical homeostasis, regulated by the balance of intercellular tension and extracellular matrix adhesion forces. In the outer retina, the significance of this force balance and its consequences for vision remains poorly understood. We found that the density of basement membrane laminins modulates the level of retinal pigmented epithelium contractility, which directly controls its efficiency in phagocytosing photoreceptor outer segments. In vivo, the density gradient of laminins follows retinal functional demand, supporting the physiological role of laminins in controlling epithelial mechanical homeostasis. Our data suggest that laminin density and isoform heterogeneity can differentially engage integrins {beta}1 and {beta}4, the ratio of which determines the contribution of actin vs keratin cytoskeleton in balancing tissue mechanics. With this work, we suggest that the extracellular matrix-defined mechanical status of retinal pigmented epithelium is a novel parameter for visual function.

SignificanceIn the retina, the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is responsible for the daily phagocytosis of photoreceptor cell fragments, a process vital for visual function. Along the visual axis, there is a natural decrease in the ratio of photoreceptors to RPE cells, indicating a decrease in RPE functional demand. This study reveals that the density of laminins in RPE basement membrane also diminishes along this axis, critically influencing RPE function by regulating its contractility. For the first time, we demonstrate the presence of a laminin- defined mechanical gradient within the RPE, which determines its capacity to support photoreceptor cells. Our findings highlight the importance of mechanical properties as a key factor in visual function, offering new insights into retinal health and disease.",NA,"biorxiv","2024-08-15"

Glucose hypometabolism and glial activation are pathological features seen in AD brains; however, the connection between the two is not fully understood. Using a Drosophila model of AD, we identified that glucose metabolism in glia plays a critical role in neuroinflammation under disease conditions. Expression of human tau in the retinal cells, including photoreceptor neurons and pigment glia, causes photoreceptor degeneration accompanied by inclusion formation and swelling of lamina glial cells. We found that inclusions are formed by glial phagocytosis, and swelling of the laminal cortex correlates with the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Co-expression of human glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) with tau in the retina does not affect tau levels but suppresses these inflammatory responses and photoreceptor degeneration. We also found that expression of GLUT3, specifically in the pigment glia, is sufficient to suppress inflammatory phenotypes and mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in the tau-expressing retina. Our results suggest that glial glucose metabolism contributes to inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in tauopathy.",NA,"biorxiv","19955"

The extent to which these traits are correlated can elucidate their function as either redundant or multiple messages. Using the agamid lizard, Psammophilus dorsalis, as a model system we examined patterns of trait expression and the role of steroid hormones in mediating these traits during social interactions. We staged male-male interactions in the lab and measured the repertoire of display behaviour and colours, which change dynamically in the visible and ultraviolet ranges in different body regions. Additionally, we measured testosterone and corticosterone levels before and after the social trials. Our results show that within behaviour and colour trait categories, components were strongly correlated within individuals, suggesting either a shared physiological pathway or redundant information content. However, across trait categories, correlation patterns varied. The chromatic contrast of the (yellow) dorsal region of lizards was correlated with both body size and level of aggression, whereas the size of UV patches was correlated with body size only. We also found a negative association between baseline corticosterone levels, body size and dorsal yellow chromatic contrast, suggesting a mechanistic link between these traits. However, social interaction induced testosterone and corticosterone levels were uncorrelated with the expression of the dynamic behavioural and colour displays during the social interactions itself. Notably, the intensity of colour and behavioural displays of males were matched by their opponents. Overall, our results suggest that multiple signalling traits can ensure both redundancy as well as provide multiple messages to receivers, thus improving the robustness of information transfer, particularly during competitions which have high fitness consequences.",NA,"biorxiv","19955"

Social status and animal colouration are covarying traits that are plastic in response to dynamic environments. In the African cichlid, Astatotilapia burtoni, body colouration and behaviour have been extensively reported to vary with social rank. However, the nature of the interaction between these two traits is poorly understood. We hypothesise that pigmentation patterns could be linked to the behavioural repertoires underlying social status and can be resolved to regions on the cichlid body plan. To test this hypothesis, we generated Territorial (T) and Non-territorial (NT) males and employed computer vision tools to quantify and visualise patterns/colour enrichment associated with stereotyped T/NT male behaviour. We report colour-behaviour interactions localised in specific areas of the body and face for two colour morphs, illustrating a more nuanced view of social behaviour and pigmentation. Since behavioural and morphological variation are key drivers of selection in the East African Great Rift Lakes, we surmise our data may be translatable to other cichlid lineages and underline the importance of trait covariance in sexual selection and male competition.","NA","biorxiv","19958"
