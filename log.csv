Glucose hypometabolism and glial activation are pathological features seen in AD brains; however, the connection between the two is not fully understood. Using a Drosophila model of AD, we identified that glucose metabolism in glia plays a critical role in neuroinflammation under disease conditions. Expression of human tau in the retinal cells, including photoreceptor neurons and pigment glia, causes photoreceptor degeneration accompanied by inclusion formation and swelling of lamina glial cells. We found that inclusions are formed by glial phagocytosis, and swelling of the laminal cortex correlates with the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Co-expression of human glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) with tau in the retina does not affect tau levels but suppresses these inflammatory responses and photoreceptor degeneration. We also found that expression of GLUT3, specifically in the pigment glia, is sufficient to suppress inflammatory phenotypes and mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in the tau-expressing retina. Our results suggest that glial glucose metabolism contributes to inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in tauopathy.",NA,"biorxiv",19955,FALSE

The extent to which these traits are correlated can elucidate their function as either redundant or multiple messages. Using the agamid lizard, Psammophilus dorsalis, as a model system we examined patterns of trait expression and the role of steroid hormones in mediating these traits during social interactions. We staged male-male interactions in the lab and measured the repertoire of display behaviour and colours, which change dynamically in the visible and ultraviolet ranges in different body regions. Additionally, we measured testosterone and corticosterone levels before and after the social trials. Our results show that within behaviour and colour trait categories, components were strongly correlated within individuals, suggesting either a shared physiological pathway or redundant information content. However, across trait categories, correlation patterns varied. The chromatic contrast of the (yellow) dorsal region of lizards was correlated with both body size and level of aggression, whereas the size of UV patches was correlated with body size only. We also found a negative association between baseline corticosterone levels, body size and dorsal yellow chromatic contrast, suggesting a mechanistic link between these traits. However, social interaction induced testosterone and corticosterone levels were uncorrelated with the expression of the dynamic behavioural and colour displays during the social interactions itself. Notably, the intensity of colour and behavioural displays of males were matched by their opponents. Overall, our results suggest that multiple signalling traits can ensure both redundancy as well as provide multiple messages to receivers, thus improving the robustness of information transfer, particularly during competitions which have high fitness consequences.",NA,"biorxiv",19955,FALSE

However, the nature of the interaction between these two traits is poorly understood. We hypothesise that pigmentation patterns could be linked to the behavioural repertoires underlying social status and can be resolved to regions on the cichlid body plan. To test this hypothesis, we generated Territorial (T) and Non-territorial (NT) males and employed computer vision tools to quantify and visualise patterns/colour enrichment associated with stereotyped T/NT male behaviour. We report colour-behaviour interactions localised in specific areas of the body and face for two colour morphs, illustrating a more nuanced view of social behaviour and pigmentation.

UV sensitivity and UV colour signals are essential for feeding and form the basis for a secret communication channel invisible to the many UV-blind predatory fish on the reef; however, how these traits develop across ontogenetic stages, and their distribution across the damselfish family is poorly characterised. Here, we used UV photography, phylogenetic reconstructions of opsin genes, differential gene expression analysis (DGE) of retinal samples, to investigate the development of UV vision and colour patterns in three ontogenetic stages (pre-settlement larval, juvenile, and adult) of eleven damselfish species. Using DGE, we found similar gene expression between juveniles and adults, which strongly differed from larvae. All species and all stages expressed at least one UV-sensitive sws1 opsin gene. However, UV body colour patterns only started to appear at the juvenile stage. Moreover, Pomacentrus species displayed highly complex UV body patterns that were correlated with the expression of two sws1 copies. This could mean that some damselfishes can discriminate colours that change only in their UV component. We demonstrate dramatic shifts in both UV sensitivity and UV colouration across the development stages of damselfish, while highlighting the importance of considering ontogeny when studying the coevolution of visual systems and colour signals.",NA,"biorxiv",19959,FALSE

Analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of CT-type signaling has revealed the occurrence of CT-type peptides and CTR/CLR-type proteins in deuterostome and protostome invertebrates. Furthermore, experimental studies have revealed that in the protostome Drosophila melanogaster the CT-like peptide DH31 can act as a ligand for a CTR/CLR-type receptor and a pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) receptor. Here we investigated the signaling mechanisms and functions of CT-type neuropeptides in a deuterostome invertebrate, the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (phylum Echinodermata). In A. japonicus, a single gene encodes two CT-type peptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2), both of which act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor (AjCTR) and two PDF-type receptors (AjPDFR1, AjPDFR2), but with differential activation of downstream cAMP/PKA, Gq/Ca2+/PKC and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Analysis of the expression of the gene encoding AjCT1 and AjCT2 revealed transcripts in a variety of organ systems, but with highest expression in the circumoral nervous system. In vitro pharmacological experiments revealed that AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 cause dose-dependent relaxation of longitudinal body wall muscle and intestine preparations. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacological experiments and loss-of-function tests revealed a potential physiological role for AjCT2 signaling in promoting feeding and growth in A. japonicus. This is the first study to obtain evidence that CT-type peptides can act as ligands for both CTR/CLR-type and PDF-type receptors in a deuterostome.

However, whether these relationships influence attention remains unclear. Additionally, whether facial expressions affect selective attention is unknown; for example, reddish angry faces increase negative social evaluation or emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether selective attention is similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 amplitudes for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, there was no significant main effect or interaction effect of facial expression or facial color on P1 amplitudes for the target, and there were significant main effects of facial expression only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the intensity of a human's selective attention to facial expressions varies according to the higher-order semantic processing of the relationship between emotion and color rather than simple facial expression or facial color effects individually.

Using an automated behavioral tracking system, we also report that mosquitoes exhibit daily modulation of response persistence to the host cue carbon dioxide and loss of PDF alters this pattern.

Being the most species-rich lineage in the magnoliids, Annonaceae are a major flowering plant component of tropical rainforests, and are important in the plant-pollinator network of this biome. Insects such as beetles, flies, bees, cockroaches and thrips have been reported as their pollinators. Although there has been considerable effort to assess their interactions with pollinators, attempts to characterise the visual and olfactory communication channels between them are scarce. Here, we report the floral phenology and characterise the spectral reflectance and odour of 12 Annonaceae species from five genera, viz. Meiogyne, Monoon, Polyalthia, Pseuduvaria, and Uvaria. Pseuduvaria species are either monoecious or dioecious while the four genera produce hermaphroditic flowers. The Meiogyne species are likely pollinated by small beetles; the Polyalthia and Pseuduvaria species are likely pollinated by both beetles and flies; and the Uvaria species is likely pollinated by both beetles and bees. All species produce flowers that are not reflective in the 300-350 nm UV spectrum, and have various spectral reflectance profile across the remaining UV and visible spectra. We detected diverse floral volatiles across all the species assessed. The flowers of the small beetle-pollinated species, including Meiogyne species and Polyalthia xanthocarpa, emitted mostly branched-chain esters, including isobutyl acetate and isoamyl acetate. The Pseuduvaria species emitted scent reminiscent of rotten fruit, largely consisting of 2,3-butanediol, a common by-product in yeast fermentation. The flowers of Uvaria concava, which were visited by both bees and beetles, released mainly straight-chain esters, including methyl hexanoate and methyl (Z)-4-octenoate. A corrugated inner petal outgrowth was observed in Meiogyne and Pseuduvaria; this functions as a food body reward in Meiogyne, but as a nectary gland for Pseuduvaria.

Pollinators often show a positive frequency-dependent foraging which confers reproductive advantage to common morphs over rare morphs. However, pollinator-mediated selections often act on visual floral displays. Here, we investigate hawkmoth-mediated selection in a nocturnal Curcuma caulina (Zingiberaceae) with bract colour polymorphism, where the role of visual display is minimal. We used path analyses to explain maintenance of differential morph abundances in C. caulina. For this, we quantified inter-morph trait variations in floral structures, nectar traits, pollinator visitations, physiological compatibilities and reproductive fitness. We noted that the rarest morph was self-compatible, exhibited higher nectar reward and pollinator visits, and low reproductive fitness, whereas the two common morphs were complete to partially self-incompatible, with lower nectar rewards and pollinator visits, but higher reproductive fitness. We conclude that while hawkmoths show a positive response to floral rewards, self-compatibility confers lower reproductive fitness to the nectar-rich rare morphs. In contrast, self-incompatibility confers higher fitness to the common morphs despite lower pollinator visits. Thus, colour polymorphism in nocturnal C. caulina is explained by floral traits associated with bract colour, which are under pollinator-mediated selection.",NA,"biorxiv",19991,FALSE

Phytoplankton 18S rRNA sequences were sampled over a one-month period in surface seawater and within bulk-collected and individually-isolated sinking particles using mesopelagic sediment traps (100-500m). Nearly all phytoplankton amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) exported from the surface were packaged in large (>300 m) particles. Individually, these particles contained only a few distinct phytoplankton ASVs, but collectively, large particles transported about half of the surface taxonomic diversity into the mesopelagic. The relative sequence abundances of the surface community detected within particles were quantitatively related to measured POC fluxes: a linear model based on the relative sequence abundance of just two pigment-based phytoplankton taxa, diatoms and photosynthetic Hacrobia, was predictive of POC flux magnitude. These two taxa were also enriched within the ecologically-distinct particle classes that had the greatest influence on carbon export magnitude.

Pigment was extracted by solvent extraction method and the best solvent was selected based on its ability to dissolve the culture suspension. The pigment was characterized using spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. Culture agitation rate, initial medium pH and concentration of yeast extract were identified as the most significant (p< 0.0001) variables affecting pigment production. At optimized conditions, 0.96 g/L of pigment was extracted from 4.73 g/L of culture biomass and the extracted pigment under optimized conditions was 1.6 times higher than the pigment extracted under un-optimized conditions. The spectroscopic and chromatographic analyses demonstrated the presence of different functional groups and carotenoids were identified as parts of the molecule responsible for the yellowish-orange pigmentation of the extract. This study demonstrated the potential for optimization of pigment production by bacteria using agro-waste extract as substrate. Hence, the current findings strongly encourage for further study at a large-scale level for industrial production.",NA,"biorxiv",20014,FALSE

The evolution of facial expressions in these animals can also manifest in taxa other than mammals, as suggested by various studies highlighting the socio-ecological benefits of facial expressions. In this study, we elucidated the social function of facial coloration, determined by melanophores, in the neotropical social cichlid Symphysodon aequifasciatus. In this species, facial coloration exhibits flexibility and instantaneous changes in response to varying social contexts. Through behavioral observations and experimental manipulation, we confirmed that facial coloration in S. aequifasciatus serves to attenuate unnecessary aggressive competition among conspecifics. Furthermore, we observed that the facial area subjected to coloration in this species is innervated by the adenosine triphosphate- and noradrenaline-ergic nervous system. These findings indicated that facial expression in S. aequifasciatus depends on the sympathetic nervous system and has evolved independently of mammalian facial expressions.

Our comprehensive analysis of 43 years of plumage color scores from a bi-morphic Finnish population of tawny owls (Strix aluco) reveals that intra-morph variation is substantial, but also unexpectedly dynamic. We show that both morphs recently diverged in their plumage coloration: while the brown morph is on a steady trajectory toward more intense plumage pigmentation, the gray morph has recently shifted toward lighter plumage, following a series of extreme winters. Evidence suggests that this divergence is driven by the brown morph's higher reproductive success and greater plasticity in response to seasonality, while the gray morph, with its more genetically determined plumage color and limited standing variation, has a reduced capacity to respond to selection and track new phenotypic optima. Our study confirms the presence of substantial and dynamic phenotypic variation within genetically discrete color morphs, and demonstrates its relevance for the evolutionary potential of populations to respond to environmental change.",NA,"biorxiv",20017,FALSE

However, the O gene in the cat genome has not been identified, and the genetic variation responsible for the orange coloration remains unknown. We report here that a 5.1-kilobase (kb) deletion within an intron of the X-linked ARHGAP36 gene, encoding a Rho GTPase activating protein, is closely and exclusively associated with orange coloration. The deleted region contains a highly conserved putative regulatory element, whose removal presumably cause altered ARHGAP36 expression. Notably, ARHGAP36 expression in cat skin tissues is linked to the suppression of many melanogenesis genes, potentially shifting pigment synthesis from eumelanin to pheomelanin. Furthermore, we find evidence that the gene undergoes XCI in female human and mouse cells, and XCI-dependent CpG island methylation consistent with random XCI in female domestic cats.

However, identification of novel SMs and their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), has become increasingly difficult, especially in Bacilli, as the tools for screening and genome mining are dependent on clear function or similarity to already known BGCs. Pigments are SMs identified by their absorption of visible light, resulting in a certain color perceived by our eyes at sufficient concentrations. Thereby, pigments provide the evidence of a BGC without knowing the sequence or function. Expanding the known repertoire of SM BGCs with novel BGCs will further reinforce identification of a broader set of BGCs by mining tools such as antiSMASH. Here, we study a pigment observed in B. subtilis soil isolate MB9_B4 on certain media. We characterize the conditions where this pigment is produced and identify the corresponding BGC using a comparative genomic approach exploiting our strain collection containing other isolates with pigment production ability. The responsible BGC carried several genes, which were annotated as parts of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway, possibly originating from a duplication and divergence of an originally primary metabolism. Identification of the pigment gene cluster additionally lead to the discovery of additional pigment BGC carrier B. subtilis isolates, some of which were described at the earliest in 1896 under the name Bacillus aterrimus, with a name referring to a dark pigmentation (the Latin aterrimus meaning very black).

Recently, a two-step mechanism, with the enzymes cytochrome P450 2J19 (CYP2J19) and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1-like (BDH1L), was described for the biosynthesis of red ketocarotenoids from yellow dietary carotenoids in the retina and plumage of birds. A common assumption has been that all birds with ketocarotenoid-based plumage coloration used this CYP2J19/BDH1L mechanism to produce red feathers. We tested this assumption in house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) by examining the catalytic function of the house finch homologs of these enzymes and tracking their expression in molting birds. We found that CYP2J19 and BDH1L did not catalyze the production of 3-hydroxy-echinenone (3-OH-echinenone), the primary red plumage pigment of house finches, when provided with common dietary carotenoid substrates. Moreover, gene expression analyses revealed little to no expression of CYP2J19 in liver tissue or growing feather follicles, the putative sites of pigment metabolism in molting house finches. Finally, although the hepatic mitochondria of house finches have high concentrations of 3-OH-echinenone, observations using fluorescent markers suggest that both CYP2J19 and BDH1L localize to the endomembrane system rather than the mitochondria. We propose that house finches and other birds that deposit 3-OH-echinenone as their primary red plumage pigment use an alternative enzymatic pathway to produce their characteristic red ketocarotenoid-based coloration.",NA,"biorxiv",20058,FALSE

We found that RPE thickness is not phenotypically or globally genetically correlated with hair colour, skin colour or ability to tan. Whilst RPE thickness was phenotypically correlated with retinal pigmentation score, there was not significant global genetic correlation. Despite this, variants in key pigmentation loci including TYR, and OCA2-HERC2 were found to be significant in our GWAS of RPE thickness. Furthermore, we identified four genetic regions in which RPE thickness is locally genetically correlated with other pigmentation-related traits, all of which contain protein-coding genes that are central to melanogenesis and melanosome transport.

We studied the simultaneous identification of illumination and reflectance changes with realistically rendered, abstract 3D-scenes. Observers were tasked to identify both of these changes between sequentially presented stimuli. The stimuli included a central object whose reflectance could vary, and a background that only varied due to changes in illumination chromaticity. We manipulated the visual cues available in the background: local contrast and specular highlights. Identification of illumination and reflectance changes was not independent: While reflectance changes were rarely mis-identified as illumination changes, illumination changes clearly biased reflectance judgments. However, correct identification of reflectance changes was also not fully dependent on correctly identifying the illumination change: Only when there was no illumination change in the stimulus did it lead to better color constancy, that is, correctly identifying the reflectance change. Discriminability of illumination changes did not vary based on available visual cues, but discriminability of reflectance changes was improved with local contrast, and to a lesser extent with specular highlights, in the stimulus.

However, as all prevalent leaf color indices used for this purpose have been developed using green-leaved plants, they do not perform reliably for anthocyanin (Anth)-rich red-leaved varieties. Hence, the present study investigates digital color indices for six types of leafy vegetables with different levels of Anth to identify congruent trends that could be implemented universally for non-invasive crop monitoring irrespective of species and leaf Anth content. For this, datasets from three digital color spaces, viz., RGB (Red, Green, Blue), HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value), and L*a*b* (Lightness, Redness-greenness, Yellowness-blueness), as well as various derived plant color indices were compared with SPAD Chl meter readings and Anth/Chl ratio of n = 320 leaf samples. Results: While most digital color features and indices presented abrupt shifts between Anth-rich and green-leaved samples, the newly-developed color index Two-fold Red Excess (TREx) as well as the color feature R showed very strong correlation with SPAD readings (R2 > 0.84), and did not exhibit any deviation due to leaf Anth content. Moreover, both parameters could predict SPAD values reliably (R2 > 0.75).

Recently, transgenic lettuce has been developed to improve agronomic traits. Although plant regeneration is a key step in plant genetic transformation, it depends strongly on the cultivar. In this study, shoot regeneration efficiency was measured by using two leaf lettuce cultivars, Chima-sanchi, white seed cultivar, and Chirimen-chisya, brown seed cultivar, a basal salt mixture, and a combination of the cytokinin, 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), and an auxin, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Efficient shoot regeneration in Chima-sanchi was thus obtained on 1 x Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) with 0.05 mg L-1 BAP and 0.1 mg L-1 NAA. However, the highest efficiency was obtained in Chirimen-chisya on 1 x MS with 0.5 mg L-1 BAP and 0.1 mg L-1 NAA. Therefore, the BAP concentration for efficient shoot regeneration differs significantly between the two cultivars. These cultivars also have different seed coat colors. Due to the similar results obtained from analyzing 4 additional cultivars, 2 white seed cultivars and 2 brown seed cultivars, we demonstrated a strong correlation between the BAP concentration for efficient shoot regeneration and the seed coat color in leaf lettuce.",NA,"biorxiv",20070,FALSE

We further examined the pathogenic G175S mutation linked to pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS). Structural analysis showed that the G175S mutation introduces an additional hydrogen bond, stabilizing a novel fibril conformation. In vitro assays demonstrated a fourfold increase in polymerization efficiency for the G175S mutant compared to the wild-type. This enhanced polymerization correlated with a ~70% increase in secreted amyloids in G175S-expressing cells without detectable changes in melanosome morphology or number.

The growing toolbox of dyes and aptamers allows simultaneous or sequential monitoring of different RNAs. However, few orthogonal aptamer-dye pairs meet all the requirements of multiplex imaging in terms of brightness, contrast, etc., thus necessitating their optimization and further diversification. Here, we report new fluorogenic ligands for the Mango II aptamer, one of the most stable and widely used RNA tags. They are based on the cognate Mango ligand TO1-B, which is a thiazole orange (TO) derivative with a biotinylated tetraethylene glycol (TEG) residue attached via an amide linker, and its analogue with an isosteric triazolyl linker (TO1-triazolyl-TEG-biotin). Structural data suggested that the biotin residue might be dispensable for interactions with Mango, so we replaced it with a second TO residue or the alternative push-pull system, namely the dimethylaminophenyl (DMAP) group linked to the benzothiazolyl (BzT) group via the ethenyl linker. The resulting ""double-headed"" symmetric and asymmetric dyes showed reduced fluorescence in the free state due to intramolecular TO/TO or TO/DMAP-BzT interactions. The asymmetric dye exhibited intramolecular FRET in complex with Mango, resulting in a remarkably large (130 nm) Stocks shift, which may be advantageous for multiplex imaging. The main limitation of the ""double-headed"" dyes was their low brightness. To improve brightness, we further optimized the truncated (biotin-free) TO1-triazolyl-TEG dye by introducing a hydroxy or a methoxy group into the methylqunolinium (MQ) fragment of its push-pull system. The brightness of the methoxy-MQ derivative was increased by 40% compared to the reported TO1-triazolyl-TEG-biotin. Importantly, the methoxy-MQ derivative also showed increased selectivity for Mango over other noncanonical nucleic acids structures, making it a promising alternative to known TO-based dyes for high-contrast RNA imaging.",NA,"biorxiv",20070,FALSE

Mormon Fritillary butterflies (Speyeria mormonia) exhibit a striking wing color polymorphism throughout their range: typical morphs bear silver spots on their ventral surfaces, and can co-occur with unsilvered morphs displaying a dull coloration. Through genome-wide association studies in two polymorphic populations, we fine-map this difference in silvering to the 3' region of the transcription factor gene optix. The expression of optix is confined to the unsilvered regions that surround the spots, and these patterns are transformed to a silver identity upon optix RNAi knockdown, implicating optix as a repressor of silver scales in this butterfly. We show that the unsilvered optix haplotype shows signatures of recent selective sweeps, and that this allele is shared with the monomorphic, unsilvered species Speyeria hydaspe, suggesting that introgressions facilitate the exchange of variants of adaptive potential across species. Remarkably, these findings parallel the role of introgressions and cis-regulatory modulation of optix in shaping the aposematic red patterns of Heliconius butterflies, a lineage that separated from Speyeria 45 million years ago. The genetic basis of adaptive variation can thus be more predictable than often presumed, even for traits that appear divergent across large evolutionary distances.",NA,"biorxiv",20075,FALSE

Although the early subcortical stages of color vision are well characterised, the organization of cortical representations of color remain elusive, despite numerous models based on discrimination thresholds, appearance and categorization. An underexplored aspect of cortical color representations is their dynamic evolution. Here we compare the evolution of three different color representations over time using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We measured neural responses to 14 hues at each of 3 achromatic offsets (increment, isoluminant and decrement) while participants attended either to the exact color of the stimulus or its color category. We used a series of classification analyses, combined with multidimensional scaling (MDS) and Representational Similarity Analysis, to ask how cortical representations of color unfold over time from stimulus onset. We compared the performance of 'higher order' models based on hue and color category with a model based simply on stimulus cone contrast and found that all models had significant correlations with the data. However, the unique variance accounted for by each model revealed a dynamic change in hue responses over time, that was consistent with a 'coarse to fine' transition from a broad clustering into categorical groups to a finer within category representation. Notably, these dynamics were replicated across datasets from both tasks, suggesting they reflect a robust reorganization of cortical hue responses over time.",NA,"biorxiv",20078,FALSE

Current methods for assessing coral health based on visual appearance, such as the use of color reference cards, are limited by subjective human color perception and low resolution. Digital photography with RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color channel analyses offers a fast, non-invasive, and standardized alternative to estimate physiological parameters. However, the link between coral color and physiological parameters during bleaching may vary depending on the type of stressor. While such approaches are extensively used in plant studies, their application in estimating Symbiodiniaceae cell density and chlorophyll content in corals requires further attention. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between Symbiodiniaceae cell density and chlorophyll content across three coral species (Acropora muricata, Pocillopora verrucosa, and Stylophora pistillata) with 19 color indices derived from the RGB channels currently established as predictors of chlorophyll content in plants. Corals were exposed to three bleaching conditions (acute short-term and chronic long-term heat stress and menthol bleaching) to identify the best color indices for assessing coral health through image analysis. We found that the Red index had the strongest linear correlation with symbiont cell density and chlorophyll content across species (R2 up to 0.97), so that relative changes in this color index can be directly interpreted as corresponding changes in tissue parameters. To train a model that predicts symbiont densities of a distinct sample set using the Red index, we found 10 to 12 samples to be sufficient to achieve an accuracy of > 95 % of the models trained on the full datasets.

Feather lice (Insecta, Phthiraptera, Ischnocera) are host-specific parasites of birds that live, feed, and breed solely on feathers. Birds defend themselves against lice, which damage feathers, by killing them with their beaks during bouts of preening. In response, feather lice have evolved background-matching cryptic coloration to help them avoid preening. We experimentally manipulated the color backgrounds of host-specific pigeon lice (Columbicola columbae) by confining them to different colored breeds of rock pigeon (Columba livia) over a period of four years (ca. 60 louse generations). Over the course of the experiment, we sampled lice from pigeons every six months for genomic resequencing, and then calculated allele frequency differences and trajectories to identify putative genomic sites under selection.

Most loci putatively under selection were unshared among replicate populations of lice, indicating that independent adaptation of distinct lineages to the same novel environment resulted in similar phenotypes driven by different genotypes.",NA,"biorxiv",20080,FALSE

To address these challenges, we introduce an ether-decorated N-terminal modification strategy for rhodamine and silicon-rhodamine (Si-rhodamine), replacing conventional N-alkyl groups. The ether chains enhance water solubility, decrease aggregate size, and improve fluorogenicity across a wide concentration range.

Particularly, some tadpoles in the genus Dryophytes in the Americas develop deep tail fins and bright orange tail coloration in response to predators such as dragonfly nymphs. These conspicuous tails are hypothesized to attract predator attacks, protecting vital body parts from fatal injuries. However, it remains unclear whether the extent of the induced phenotypic changes differs between various predators with distinct feeding patterns and habitats. To explore this, we reared tadpoles of the Japanese tree frog, Dryophytes japonicus, with four dragonfly species, water bug, water scorpion, or newt, and measured phenotypic changes, especially focusing on tail coloration. We found that the aeshnid Anax nigrofasciatus, a sit-and-wait predator that climbs on aquatic vegetation, induced bright orange and broad tails of tadpoles. Other odonate species that forage in and on the substrate also elicited tail coloration or deeper larval tails, but it took more time to induce the tadpoles' response compared to A. nigrofasciatus. In contrast, non-odonate predators did not induce color and morphological changes. This study provides the first evidence of predator-induced tail coloration in an Asian species of Dryophytes, which appears to be a defensive response specifically to dragonfly nymphs, as visually adept predators. Moreover, the differences in the extent and timing of the phenotypic changes among odonate species suggest that anti-predator phenotypes are modulated based on relative predation risks, considering the predators' foraging patterns and visual capabilities, thereby allowing tadpoles to minimize physiological costs and unintended risks associated with the induced traits.",NA,"biorxiv",20106,FALSE

This study investigated age-associated transcriptomic changes in autophagy pathways in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and evaluated the protective effects of topical trehalose, an autophagy-enhancing small molecule, against light-induced outer retinal degeneration in mice. Transcriptomic analysis of human RPE/choroid and mouse RPE revealed consistent downregulation of autophagy pathways with age, alongside variable changes as AMD severity progressed. Given the age- and AMD-associated perturbation of autophagy pathways, we examined trehalose treatment in vitro, which enhanced autophagic flux and restored mitochondrial respiratory function in primary murine RPE cells exposed to oxidative stress. In vivo, topical trehalose improved autophagy-lysosome activity in mouse RPE, demonstrated by elevated LC3B turnover and SQSTM1/p62 degradation. Furthermore, trehalose eyedrops protected mice from light-induced damage to the RPE and photoreceptors, preserving outer nuclear layer thickness, RPE morphology, and junctional F-actin organization. Taken together, the data support that age-related decline and severe dysregulation in autophagy contributed to AMD progression.

Using long-read sequencing, we investigated structural variations underlying four major alleles (I, ii, ik, and i) at the I locus. Our study revealed that large-scale rearrangements, including duplications, inversions, and deletions, within a 180-kb CHS repeat-rich region drive allele-specific RNA silencing through small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The dominant I allele contains a cis-regulatory region of DnaJ upstream of CHS genes, while the ii and ik alleles feature subtilisin- and P450-driven siRNA loci, respectively. The recessive i allele lacks siRNA production due to deletions or inversions disrupting CHS gene clusters. Phenotypic analyses and RNA-seq confirmed allele-specific, tissue-dependent expression of siRNAs correlating with seed coat pigmentation patterns.

Spontaneous associations between different sensory modalities -crossmodal associations- are widely observed in humans. More recently, crossmodal associations have been reported in chimpanzees, monkeys, dogs, chickens, and tortoises, indicating a general cognitive strategy that reflects natural correlations in the environment or similarities in the architecture of the nervous system. Alternatively, or complementarily, crossmodal associations may arise from learning of species-specific occurrences. Recent research on primates has tentatively linked human pitch-luminance associations to the evolution of language. While humans and chimpanzees spontaneously match a high-pitched sound with a white shape and a low-pitched sound with a black shape, baboons and chickens do not exhibit any preferential association. Identifying spontaneous pitch-luminance associations in species that do not rely on vocal communication, such as the solitary Hermann's tortoises, would support the idea of a language-independent phenomenon. To test this idea, we studied tortoises for pitch-luminance associations in a spontaneous food-searching task. After hearing a high-pitched (700 Hz) vs low-pitched (450 Hz) sound, animals could choose to search for food behind either a light- or dark-coloured wall. When hearing the high-pitched sound, tortoises chose the white stimulus, whereas when hearing the low-pitched sound, they chose the black stimulus, similarly to what humans and chimpanzees do.

We gathered internet photographs of flower-visiting bees and wasps, their hoverfly mimics, and non-mimicking hoverflies, and compared the colours of the visited flowers. Flowers visited by bumblebees were ""bluer"" than those visited by other hymenopterans (honeybees, wasps and solitary bees).

There was no such pattern in flower ""yellowness"", where all flies and most hymenopterans preferred similar yellowness, and only bumblebees chose less yellow flowers than the others. Our study demonstrates widespread changes in microhabitat choice (specifically flower preference) among a diverse group of Batesian mimics, consistent with the idea of behavioural mimicry.

However, it is not known whether sexual conflict can also explain the evolutionary origin of female-limited colour morphs, and if so, what ecological factors play a role in this macroevolutionary transition, by modulating the strength of the conflict. Furthermore, the effects of sexual conflict on phylogenetic diversification remain controversial, in particular, whether sexual conflict elevates speciation rates, extinction rates, or both. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to show that female colour polymorphisms are more likely to evolve when population densities at breeding sites are high, and that these demographic conditions are more common at high latitudes and in open landscapes. We show that female-limited polymorphisms typically evolve from sexually dimorphic ancestors through the addition of a male-like female morph, consistent with the hypothesis of selection for male mimicry. Female colour polymorphisms increase both speciation and extinction rates, leading to higher evolutionary turnover of polymorphic lineages. We conclude that female colour polymorphisms evolve in a predictable fashion, and are likely driven by ecological conditions that increase the rate of pre-mating interactions and thus the intensity of sexual conflict.

This complex requires an intact microtubule cytoskeleton. Vinculin tension-sensing constructs quantified intracellular forces, with an average force of 3.0 {+/-} 1.0 pN per focal adhesion. These findings corroborate the mechanosensitive role of vinculin and its interaction with RIAM in a force-independent manner. This study demonstrates the utility of Cascade-FRET and TCSPC-FLIM in investigating multicomponent molecular complexes. Our findings provide novel insights into RIAM-vinculin interactions and their regulation by intracellular tension, paving the way for advanced applications of Cascade-FRET in dynamic cellular systems.",NA,"biorxiv",20158,TRUE

In mice, as in other mammals, color vision originates in the retina, where photoreceptor signals are processed by neural circuits. However, retinal responses to stimuli involving multiple colors are still not well understood. One possible explanation of this knowledge gap is that previous studies have not thoroughly examined how neuronal activity adapts to a 30 seconds to a few minutes timescale when exposed to multiple color sources. To address this, we systematically varied the UV-to-green light balance with a custom-built stimulator targeting mice opsins spectra while recording retinal ganglion cell responses in the ventral retina using multielectrode arrays. Responses to full-field chirp and checkerboard stimulations with alternating UV and green light revealed that more than one order of magnitude of intensity difference favoring green M-opsin over UV S-opsin is needed for a balanced reliability in retinal ganglion cell responses. An incorrect balance, with slightly increased UV light, silenced responses to green illumination. To determine if these values are consistent with natural conditions, we analyzed isomerisation rates in the mouse retina across different times of the day. We found that the M- to S-opsin activation ratio remains constant through the mesopic-photopic range, and our empirically determined values align well with these natural conditions, lying far from a simple equalization of M- and S-opsin isomerisation rates. In conclusion, a finely tuned color intensity balance is essential for accurately measuring both fast temporal responses and detailed spatial receptive fields.",NA,"biorxiv",20161,FALSE

Sparse fNIRS arrays with 30mm channel spacing are widely used but have limited spatial resolution.

A statistical comparison of HD and sparse arrays is needed for evaluating the benefits and trade-offs of HD arrays. Aim: This study provides a statistical comparison of HD and sparse fNIRS performance to inform array selection in future research. Approach: We measured prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation during congruent and incongruent Word-Color Stroop (WCS) tasks using both Sparse and HD arrays for 17 healthy adult participants, comparing dorsolateral PFC channel and image results at the group level. Results: While both arrays detected activation in channel space during incongruent WCS, channel and image space results demonstrated superior localization and sensitivity with the HD array for all WCS. Conclusions: Sparse channel data may suitably detect activation from cognitively demanding tasks, like incongruent WCS.

For instance, cone signals from natural environments are highly correlated across cone types, indicating channel redundancy. Early visual processing transforms the signals into color and luminance information, such as principle component analysis, and thus achieves efficient and decorrelated representations of natural scenes. Building on these findings, previous research has investigated the effect of color on visual tasks such as object recognition using grayscale conversion, which separates luminance from color. However, recent work suggests that when focusing on object materials, color and luminance remain highly redundant due to complex optical properties. Although this finding indicates that there may be a more efficient decomposition of signals, the specific algorithms remain unknown. This study derives that a classic computer graphics algorithm, the median cut, offers a novel approach to enhance visual processing efficiency while capturing diagnostic features to separate material from object geometry information. Human behavioral experiments show that color reduction based on the algorithm disturbs material classification while preserving object recognition. These findings suggest that object geometric structures are available only from low-bit information.

While promising, such findings were based on abstract and two-dimensional stimuli only. Before extending this framework to more realistic AR scenarios, an essential next step is to assess whether the physical gamut theory also applies to naturalistic stimuli. This study addresses that gap. Our results reveal that the physical gamut remains a valid construct for natural objects viewed in realistic scenes.

Achieving crypsis often requires acquiring dietary carotenoids--tetraterpene pigments vital for plant colouration and photoprotection. Silicon (Si) accumulation in plants makes tissues tougher and less digestible for insects, but its effect on plant pigment levels remains unclear. It is also unknown whether feeding on silicified plants impairs insects' ability to sequester carotenoids and achieve crypsis. Using the model grass Brachypodium distachyon, we demonstrate that the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) larvae exhibited stunted growth and reduced carotenoid sequestration, particularly lutein, into their hemolymph when feeding on Si-supplemented (+Si) plants. This reduction led to distinct body-colour morphs: larvae feeding on +Si plants developed brown colouration, contrasting sharply with the green leaves, whereas larvae feeding on Si-free (-Si) plants exhibited green cryptic colouration that blended seamlessly with the foliage. Plant leaves contained various carotenoids (neoxanthin, violaxanthin, {beta}-carotene and lutein) and chlorophylls (a and b), but larvae only sequestered {beta}-carotene and lutein into their haemolymph while excreting substantial amounts of pigments, regardless of plant Si status. Under insect-free conditions, +Si plants had lower carotenoid and chlorophyll contents than -Si plants. However, following insect herbivory, pigment levels in -Si and +Si plants equalised. Insect herbivory also increased Si accumulation in +Si plants. Our findings provide novel evidence that plant Si defences can disrupt cryptic colouration in insect herbivores by restricting carotenoid sequestration from host plant tissues.

Two hypotheses are often invoked to explain how carotenoid-based colorations function as reliable individual quality signals. The first hypothesis suggests that carotenoid allocation trade-offs between signaling and survival-related functions maintain signal reliability. Only high-quality individuals could resolve these trade-offs without incurring a fitness loss. Such signals are plastic, and the signaler can strategically manage their expression level to increase fitness returns. The second hypothesis posits that certain carotenoid-based signals are strongly constrained in their expression, not allowing strategic manipulations or cheating. We challenged captive male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with simulated infections by injecting lipopolysaccharides (LPS) derived from Escherichia coli and assessed organ masses, body temperature, and carotenoid levels in several tissues. Compared to controls, LPS-treated birds reduced the bill redness, a sexual signal. However, this reduction was largely explained by decreased food intake caused by LPS.

To explore the influences of drift and selection we investigated patterns of flower color variation among populations of the introduced ornamental mustard, Hesperis matronalis, along an urban-rural gradient in eastern Ontario Canada.

MethodsWe surveyed 136 naturalized stands of H. matronalis over three generations, and for each stand estimated the diversity of the three color morphs (white, pink, purple), the number of reproductive plants, and the degree of urbanization based on night sky brightness.

Key ResultsFlower color morph diversity increased with both stand size and urbanization which is consistent with effects of genetic drift during colonization combined with multiple introductions of this horticultural plant in urban areas. However, the frequency and fixation of the purple morph systematically increased towards the rural end of the gradient. Although lifetime seed production did not vary among morphs, pre-dispersal seed predation by a recently adventive weevil was higher in the purple morph, particularly in rural areas. Estimated seed production in the absence of predation suggests a previous fitness advantage for the purple and pink morphs in rural areas and for the white morph in urban areas.

This is hard for the user to set ahead of time, and suboptimal settings can harm sensitivity and specificity. Methods that use compressed full-text indexes like SPUMONI2 and Cliffy lift this constraint, but are less efficient than k-mer-based tools. Further, these methods either cannot report a full listing of genomes where a match occurs, or cannot scale to large reference databases.
