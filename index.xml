  <description>Understanding the architecture of biological adaptations is a major endeavor of evolutionary biology. Using Natural History collections, we study the genetic basis and evolution of white/brown winter coat color variation in the long-tailed weasel (Neogale frenata), a crucial phenological adaptation for camouflage in habitats with seasonal snow. We produced whole-genome sequencing data for museum specimens, along two winter color morph transition areas in North America, at the West and East coasts. Genome-wide association scans identified a single genomic region linked to color variation polymorphism with approximately 300kb and 200kb in the West and East regions, respectively, which included the pigmentation gene MC1R. We identified three MC1R alleles, two of which with deletions of nine or eight amino acids, alternatively associated with the winter brown morphs in the West and East, respectively. These deletions affect the second transmembrane domain, and in one case also the first extracellular loop, which in silico analyses predicted to impact the protein&#39;s function. Our findings show alternative intraspecific evolutionary solutions for environmental adaptation in long-tailed weasels, building on the evidence that major genes of the melanin production pathway are hotspots for recurrent and independent evolution of winter camouflage adaptation.</description>

  <description>1. Climate change poses extreme risks to biodiversity, threatening the ecosystems upon which humanity depends. Understanding the traits that mediate how organisms respond to climatic gradients in space and time will enable better predictions of the taxa and ecological communities most at risk from warming. 2. In insects, colouration influences thermoregulation, but warming responses must be traded off against other selective pressures. We hypothesise that butterfly wing reflectance in visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectra respond differently to temperature and ultraviolet radiation over space and time. We combined existing reflectance data of 97 butterfly species in both NIR and visible wavelengths, with long-term abundance monitoring data of 120 butterfly communities sampled across 1650 m altitude gradients from May to August in two time periods (2004/5 and 2017). 3. The visible and NIR reflectances of butterfly communities showed a non-linear relationship with altitude, with the lowest reflectance (darkest butterflies) at the coolest, highest sites. In contrast, community visible reflectance decreased through the year as temperatures warmed over spring-summer, whereas community NIR reflectance remained constant, revealing divergent responses of reflectance types to seasonal changes. Temperature had opposing effects on visible and NIR reflectance of butterfly communities, where increasing temperature reduced community visible reflectance strongly while increasing community NIR reflectance slightly. 4. Considering the effects on reflectance of shared evolutionary history in a Bayesian hierarchical model for individual species, lighter-coloured (more reflective) species were associated with warmer temperatures - flying later in spring-summer or at lower altitudes. However, instead of decreasing in reflectance through the year and across temperature gradients, species instead became lighter, we expect as a result of a Simpson&#39;s paradox. 5. These results emphasise how visible and NIR reflectance wavelength bands mediate butterflies&#39; responses to environmental gradients in distinct ways, despite being highly correlated across species. We also show that incorporating phylogeny into trait-environment models is essential; relying on traits alone would lead to incorrect inferences and predictions of taxa most at risk from warming climates.</description>

  <description>The representational structure of human color perception, particularly within vast color spaces, remains incompletely understood. While representational structures for dozens of colors have been studied, exploring structures spanning hundreds or thousands of colors has been infeasible due to the time costs of psychophysical experiments. Given these constraints, deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted attention as a promising tool for providing proxies or predictions of human perception beyond the scope of psychophysical experiments. However, it remains unclear which DNN models possess internal representations that geometrically align with human color perception. Furthermore, it is unclear which learning paradigm enables DNNs to acquire a color representation that is geometrically aligned with that of humans. Here, we systematically investigate which learning paradigm enables DNNs to produce a color representation that is structurally congruent with that of humans, with a focus on three types: self-supervised learning (SSL) that trains on images alone, supervised learning (SL) that trains on images with category labels, and contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) that trains on image-text pairs. We compared internal representations of DNNs with the human similarity judgments of 93 colors using a rigorous unsupervised method termed Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT), which reveals whether the representational structures of humans and models align at the fine-item level. Our results show that only the CLIP paradigm acquires color representations that strongly align with human data at the fine-item level. Furthermore, when we leveraged a key advantage of DNNs and investigated a substantial representational structure of 4096 colors, the human-aligned CLIP models consistently converged on a non-trivial distorted ring-like structure, which presents a plausible prediction for the large-scale human color representation. Our work demonstrates an approach for exploring unknown territories of human perception through the use of computational models validated in a limited empirical space, and provides predictions for future large-scale psychophysical experiments.</description>

  <title>Equiluminant Border Ownership Cells as a Missing Link in Color Form Perception</title>
  <dc:creator>Mehrani, P.</dc:creator>
  <dc:creator>Tsotsos, J. K.</dc:creator>
  <link>https://colrverse.github.io/colsci-bot/</link>
  <description>We propose the existence of a sub-population of border ownership neurons that signal figure side along equiluminant borders, those defined purely by color contrast. We postulate that these neurons, similar to primate equiluminant V1 [26] and V4 [5] cells, are strongly activated by equiluminant contrast on their preferred side, with diminished response for strictly luminance contrast. To test this hypothesis, we propose a hierarchical and mechanistic model that explains how equiluminant border ownership signals can be achieved in the ventral stream. Our simulation results suggest that model equiluminant neurons are highly color-selective while exhibiting similar orientation and border ownership selectivity as their luminance counterparts. Additionally, our model equiluminant cells indeed exhibited the above postulated pattern of responses. We suggest that these neurons are the missing links in the equiluminance channels in the ventral stream that transform equiluminant oriented edge signals in V1 to equiluminant object-centered shape representations in V4. Our findings point to the importance of re-examining the border ownership neuron population to further detail their role in equiluminant channels in the ventral stream.</description>

  <description>Among the most interesting adult traits are those with roles in animal communication. Yet developmental mechanisms by which genes drive cell behaviors in building the final forms of such traits are rarely known. In this context, pigmentation is useful because colors and patterns often provide signals in mate choice, predation avoidance and other behaviors and pigmentation is unusually accessible to observation and manipulation. Here we focus on some of the most prominent signaling colors--red, orange and yellow--and show how BMP signaling at the cellular level allows for a very different kind of signal at the organismal level. Using pearl danio, Danio albolineatus, we find that spatially and temporally graded BMP signals promote development of yellow/orange xanthophores over red erythrophores in the fin of this species and a distantly related minnow, Tanichthys albonubes, and that conserved mechanisms, involving BMP co-receptor Rgmb, regulate differentiation of other pigment cell types in corresponding locations of zebrafish, D. rerio. We further use mutants of D. albolineatus with more red or more yellow cells than wild-type to demonstrate female responsiveness to carotenoid-based color differences between males in shoaling preference assays, and we show the existence of polygenic standing variation for this pigmentary trait. Our findings illustrate a chain of function spanning hierarchical levels and provide a deeper understanding of pigmentary form and function and its evolution.</description>

  <description>Biology&#39;s strategies for manipulating light offer rich inspiration for the design of sustainable replacements to conventional pigments in paints, coatings, and displays. For these applications, where angle-independent color is required, photonic glasses, composed of random arrangements of dielectric spheres, offer a promising solution. However, their intrinsic disorder, particularly from particle polydispersity, fundamentally limits their color saturation and practical utility. In contrast, insects like damselflies and dragonflies exhibit surprisingly vivid, non-iridescent structural colors, despite relying on disordered photonic structures. Here, we show how damselflies combine compositional and structural dispersion to overcome color saturation limits of photonic glasses. Firstly, doping transparent particles with yellow pigments dramatically enhances blue-green structural resonances by the coupled effects of narrowband absorption and refractive index (material) dispersion. Secondly, the refractive index of the nanospheres varies with their size and crystallinity. This gives rise to a &#39;structural dispersion&#39; which maintains consistent optical path lengths in polydisperse assemblies, preserving high color purity. Finally, we show how damselflies tune their structural colors during maturation by precisely modulating the size of the nanospheres. Remarkably, the tuning of particle size, refractive index and pigment loading, arises naturally during the development of the pigment cells - where the pteridine nanospheres undergo a process of densification, crystallization and metabolic maturation.</description>

  <title>Egg colour mimicry in the common cuckoo results from coevolutionary alternation, not coevolutionary arms races</title>

  <description>The exquisite eggshell mimicry found in many cuckoo-host systems has been the textbook example of a coevolutionary arms race [1]. In this system, cuckoos lay their eggs in their hosts&#39; nests leaving these foster parents to rear their young [2]. In defence, most of these hosts have evolved the ability to recognize cuckoo eggs. It is long-assumed that these interactions select for ever-improving eggshell mimicry in cuckoo host-races laying distinct eggs that specifically mimic their host&#39;s eggshell, regardless of its particular colour [3,4]. We challenge this paradigm and demonstrate that coevolutionary arms races and egg colour mimicry are the exception to the rule. Here, using eggshell reflectance spectra from 39 host species and the specific cuckoo eggs found in their nests, we show that eggshell colour mimicry is very uncommon even among frequent hosts. Although cuckoo eggs display considerable variation in eggshell colour, their hosts&#39; eggshell colours occupy 6 times their colour volume. As a result, mimicry is only achieved for a small subset of the egg colour gamut. Furthermore, cuckoo host-races rarely lay eggs that match their hosts&#39; eggs better than those of other potential hosts or that are distinct from those laid by other cuckoo host-races. These patterns are inconsistent with the long-held assumption of coevolutionary arms races, but consistent with coevolutionary alternation that is defined by a process of continual host-switching. These findings open new avenues for research in a system that has long served as a model for studying coevolutionary processes.</description>

  <description>Of all visual systems shaped over billions of years, stomatopod crustaceans or mantis shrimps possess arguably one of the most extraordinary eyes, with unmatched potential for broad colour detection (T. W. Cronin &amp; Marshall, 1989; J. Marshall &amp; Oberwinkler, 1999; J. Marshall et al., 2007). Yet how their unusual diversity of visual opsins (Porter et al., 2020) maps onto functional spectral sensitivities (Streets et al., 2022; T. W. Cronin et al., 2022) has remained unresolved. Here, we uncover the molecular rhodopsin-based physiological mechanisms of spectral tuning and show that seventeen opsins, mostly from the colour-sensing midband of the Neogonodactylus oerstedii eye, exhibit distinct spectral absorption ranges and couple to Gq- or Gi-proteins. Two mid-wavelength opsins (NOMs) preferentially absorb blue light, while twelve long-wavelength opsins (NOLs) absorb in the green range. In addition, three NOLs are red-sensitive beyond 600 nm, representing the most far-red-sensitive opsins functionally characterized in animals. Several opsins exhibit photoreversibility with inverse blue-red spectral shifts, revealing an unrecognised layer of photochemical flexibility in stomatopod photoreception. Combined with ommatidial carotenoid filters, our mechanistic model shows how individually tuned rhodopsins shape row-specific spectral sensitivity across the eye, promoting far-red sensitivity in tier 3P in relation to other spectral wavelengths. These specialised rhodopsin-filter combinations collectively enable robust colour vision along a broad light spectrum and across dim and bright conditions, offering new insights into the evolution of one of Natures most sophisticated visual systems.</description>

  <description>1. Advances in digital imaging and software tools have provided increasingly accessible datasets and methods for analyzing color evolution. Despite the variety of computational packages available, most rely on color classification before running analyses. Previous methods limit the ability to analyze large-scale image databases, decreases the accuracy of downstream analyses, and is not always representative of biologically relevant color classes. 2. Here, we present charisma, an R package designed to characterize the distribution of distinct color classes in images suitable for large-scale studies of biological organisms. Here, we demonstrate the utility of our package through an analysis of color evolution in a sample of diverse and charismatic birds, tanagers, in the subfamily Thraupinae. 3. We show that charisma can quickly and accurately classify every pixel in an image and validate these results using pre-identified, canonical color swatches. We find that charisma color classifications are consistent with those made by color-pattern experts in the field. Applying charisma to tanager color evolution, we find that charisma outputs seamlessly integrate with downstream evolutionary analyses. 4. Our results demonstrate that using charisma to manually curate and characterize colors in images provides a standardized, reliable, and reproducible framework for high-throughput color classification.</description>

  <description>Beech leaf disease (BLD) is an epidemic spreading among American beech (Fagus grandifolia) populations, with characteristic symptoms including dark green, yellow, or brown bands of thickened leaf tissue between secondary veins. Whereas near infrared (NIR) light is reflected by leaf tissue structure, here we used multispectral NIR imaging to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic leaf reflectance, as well as to distinguish between different expressions of symptoms (dark green, yellow, and brown bands) within symptomatic leaves. Key findings include significantly higher NIR reflectance in dark green bands of symptomatic tissue compared to asymptomatic tissue ({lambda} = 840, 860, 900, 940, and 980 nm; [~]26.2%, 25.9%, 35.0%, 35.3%, and 32.5% increase respectively). A partial least squares regression model predicted 97% of variation in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic NIR reflectance was attributed primarily to the increase in spongy mesophyll thickness and overall leaf thickness in symptomatic tissue. Water infiltration of the intercellular airspaces in symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves removed differences in NIR reflectance, supporting a mechanistic link between increased NIR reflectance and the foliar symptoms of BLD. Our results highlight the interaction of leaf internal architecture with NIR wavelengths, and informs the development of targeted remote sensing tools, with implications for detecting even early-stage symptoms of BLD.</description>

  <description>Bioluminescent luciferases have emerged as powerful tools for bioimaging, enabling to image biological systems without external excitation light, reducing thus phototoxicity and eliminating background autofluorescence. Advanced imaging requires luciferases that deliver high photon output for enhanced sensitivity, tunable emission colors for multicolor imaging, and red-shifted emission for effective deep tissue imaging. Here, we introduce LumiFAST, a small tunable luciferase engineered by fusing the bright blue-light emitting NanoLuc with the tunable chemogenetic fluorescent reporter pFAST. pFAST binds and stabilizes the fluorescent state of a variety of synthetic fluorogenic chromophores (also called fluorogens). Its proximity with NanoLuc leads to efficient bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), enabling customizable red-shifted emission. Thanks to the small size of pFAST, LumiFAST maintains a compact structure, while its modular design allows emission color to be tuned from cyan to green, yellow, orange and red simply by changing the fluorogen. Systematic optimization of the fusion topology and linker length yielded an optimal variant with apparent BRET efficiencies reaching up to 90 %. The red-shifted emission of LumiFAST enables dual-color microscopy imaging when used alongside NanoLuc and allows imaging through thick scattering media. Beyond imaging, our insights into the structural factors governing efficient BRET allowed us to engineer biosensors based on NanoLuc and pFAST for the visualization of protease activity and protein-protein interactions in live cells.</description>

  <description>Pufferfish are well-known for their toxicity, yet they also exhibit a remarkable diversity of pigment patterns. Mushifugu (Takifugu exascurus) is a pufferfish endemic to Japan&#39;s coastal waters and is characterized by conspicuous labyrinthine patterns. Despite being recorded along both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts, it has a limited distribution and is infrequently observed. Aside from its unique body pattern, mushifugu shows little to no morphological differences from other Takifugu species, often leading to speculation that it may be an interspecific hybrid. In addition, previous theoretical and empirical studies have shown that complex camouflage-like labyrinthine patterns can emerge through the &#39;pattern blending&#39; caused by hybridization between spotted species, providing support for this possibility. Here, we investigate the phylogenetic origin of mushifugu and its distinctive pattern through population structure analysis and demographic inference in comparison with its closest spotted relative, komonfugu (T. flavipterus). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis revealed two regional haplogroups within mushifugu--one in the Sea of Japan (SJ) and the other in the Pacific Ocean (PO). In the haplotype network, the SJ haplogroup formed a distinct cluster, whereas the PO haplogroup appeared as its own cluster connected to the komonfugu haplogroup. By contrast, genome-wide SNP analyses indicated limited structure between the SJ and PO mushifugu populations, while clearly separating mushifugu from komonfugu. Coalescent-based demographic inference suggested that the two species diverged following a bottleneck event in the early Pleistocene. These results confirm that mushifugu is a distinct species rather than a recent interspecific hybrid. Nevertheless, evidence of introgression was detected in both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, suggesting multiple episodes of past hybridization between mushifugu and komonfugu, highlighting the potentially complex evolutionary processes shaping Takifugu species and their pigment patterns.</description>

  <description>MicroRNA165/166 is a highly conserved and abundant microRNA family in plants that targets class III homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) transcription factors. Their essential roles in plant development, organ polarity, meristem maintenance, and vascular differentiation have been well established. However, their role in storage organ development, particularly in potato tuberization remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate the pleiotropic effects of miR166 on potato (Solanum tuberosum spp. Andigena) growth and development. Suppression of miR166 via target mimicry (MIM166) resulted in reduced plant height, altered vascular patterning, diminished leaf curvature, and impaired root development. Remarkably, MIM166 lines produced elongated, pigmented tubers with reduced yield under short-day conditions. Transcriptomic analyses of swollen head versus stalk of tuberizing stolons revealed altered expression of auxin-, cytokinin-, and gibberellin-related genes, consistent with hormone quantification data, suggesting the key role of phytohormones in governing tuber shape. Anthocyanin profiling indicated elevated accumulation of cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, and delphinidin 3-glucoside in MIM166 tuber peels, correlating with the upregulation of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. Tuber productivity in these lines was reduced possibly due to the decreased expression of SWEET11b and distorted vascular structures in the MIM166 lines. Further, StREVOLUTA, a direct miR166 target, exhibited dynamic expression during stolon differentiation and could modulate the expression of auxin biosynthesis genes. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the miR166-HD-ZIP III module is functional in potato, plays conserved roles in regulating key developmental traits, and is active through early stolon-to-tuber transition stages, affecting tuber shape, color and productivity.</description>

  <description>Subjective color (SC) refers to chromatic perception induced by achromatic stimuli, as classically demonstrated using Benham\&#39;s top. Despite nearly two centuries of investigation, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. We developed artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural videos using predictive learning to investigate SC generation. These models successfully reproduced artificial subjective color (ASC) despite the absence of explicit color information in the training stimuli. Critically, ASC characteristics were systematically influenced by the colors of moving objects in the training videos. Using progressively simplified stimuli, ranging from natural scenes to 3D computer graphics to 2D animations, we demonstrated that the colors of moving objects are the primary determinant of ASC properties. We propose that predictive learning establishes color associations with motion patterns, causing the arcs on Benham\&#39;s top to be perceived as moving objects with their corresponding colors. These findings suggest that cortical predictive mechanisms may complement retinal processes in generating subjective color phenomena.</description>

  <description>For over a century, evolutionary biologists have been motivated to understand the mechanisms through which organisms adapt to their environments. Coloration and pigmentation are remarkably variable within and between species and can serve as an important window into the mechanisms of adaptation. Here, we map the genetic basis of a newly described iridescence trait in swordtail fish to a single locus. Individuals with this trait appear to sparkle as they move through the water. We find that the trait is driven by the recent endogenization of a retrovirus that inserted near the gene alkal2a. This insertion is associated with changes in the chromatin landscape, upregulation of alkal2a, and accumulation of iridescent cells that adhere to the scales. Rather than causing diseases, our results demonstrate that invading endogenous retroviruses can also regulate novel trait variation in the host. Moreover, we find that this coloration trait may act as an important signal in interactions between fish and their predators in the natural environment.</description>

  <description>Hybridization, or interbreeding between two previously diverged populations, is increasing due to human influences on the environment. Rates of hybridization might be increasing particularly quickly among urban species, especially those that are known to be sensitive to environmental disturbances. Butterflies are one such taxa, as some species are commonly found in urban areas, despite being sensitive indicators. For example, Colias philodice and C. eurytheme (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) hybridize when their ranges are in contact or overlap and are commonly found in large cities throughout North America. However, it is an open question how variation in urbanization might affect variation in hybridization. Using wild Colias across a gradient of urbanization in Toronto, Ontario, we tested how the variation in Colias colour, as an indicator of hybridization, relates to human disturbance and urbanization. We created an objective numeric classification for both C. eurytheme and C. philodice, against which we categorized Colias samples. We found that some of the urbanization metrics, including distance to road, Julian date, and number of pedestrians affect the variation in Colias colour, suggesting that urbanization affects Colias colouration, and potentially rates of hybridization, in Toronto. This means that human disturbance of the environment could be affecting Colias rates of hybridization.</description>

  <description>In agroecosystems, the variable expression of crop functional traits is expected to play a role in key processes, including plant nutrient cycling and water acquisition, that confer ecosystem resistance and/ or resilience to environmental change. The ability to estimate crop trait data is therefore critical to predict crop responses to environmental change, enabling more informed diagnosis of crop performance and on-farm management strategies. Yet, many traditional methods for quantifying plant traits are time-consuming and resource-intensive, limiting sample sizes and study durations. In response, high-throughput phenotyping--specifically reflectance spectroscopy-- has emerged as a key element of plant trait research, capable of estimating plant traits more rapidly. However, little is known about whether or not reflectance spectroscopy can detect within-species variation in resource acquisition and plant-water traits. Using wine grapes (V. vinifera subsp. vinifera) as a focal crop, this study aimed to assess the ability of reflectance spectroscopy and the subsequent partial least squares regression modelling approach to quantify intraspecific variation in 12 functional traits across 12 different cultivars. Results showed significant differences in traits, especially in the photosynthetic and hydraulic traits, among closely related cultivars, falling along a resource-conservative to resource-acquisitive axis of variation. We also found that reflectance differentiated this fine-scale trait variation, specifically in leaf chemical and morphological traits, contributing to higher accuracy, and indicating that this HTP approach is viable for detailed trait estimation in diverse agroecosystems.</description>

  <description>We developed a 37-color spectral flow cytometry panel to characterize T cell function, with a focus CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, in the human intestine. The panel includes lineage-defining transcription factors, markers for memory status, tissue residency and T cell activation, and 11 cytokines representing multiple Th cell lineages. The panel is currently being used to investigate CD4+ Th cell function in intestinal and peripheral blood samples of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. The panel could however be applied to investigate both peripheral and tissue-resident T cell function in a range of immune-mediated diseases.</description>

  <description>The evolution of more complex brains required existing neurons and neural circuits to accommodate new inputs. The genetic and developmental mechanisms that enable such integration are largely unknown. Butterflies evolved more complex retinal mosaics through the addition of a second R7 color photoreceptor per ommatidium (unit eye). In Drosophila, the unique R7 makes a stochastic choice to express one of two opsin genes. In butterflies, the two R7s make two independent stochastic cell fate choices in each ommatidium, producing three ommatidial types instead of the two in flies. Here, we investigate the developmental basis of this change and how the butterfly brain accommodates an expansion in sensory receptor input. We first identified the developmental mechanisms that specify the second R7 cell. We then modified Drosophila retinas to have butterfly-like transcription factor expression, causing recruitment of an additional R7. The two R7s make independent stochastic choices, like butterflies, leading to three stochastically distributed ommatidial types instead of two. In Drosophila, each of the two subtypes of R7s connects to one of two types of Dm8 neurons. Dm8 neurons of both types are born in excess, with Dm8s that are not connected to their cognate R7s undergoing apoptosis. In the presence of extra R7s in butterfly-like retinas, additional Dm8s are retained, leading to two Dm8s per medulla column. We propose a model in which population-level variation in the ratio of R7 subtypes produced in the retina maintains an excess pool of two types of potentially interacting partners in the brain, thus providing developmental flexibility which allows brains to accommodate additional inputs. We demonstrate how excess neurons that are eliminated in normal development facilitated the expansion of color vision in butterflies, and similar cooption events may represent a general mechanism of neural evolution.</description>

  <title>Opposing seasonal dynamics in phylogenetic and flower color diversity of co-flowering wildflower assemblages</title>

  <description>Flower color is a key trait mediating plant-pollinator interactions, yet the ecological rules governing its distribution across co-flowering assemblages remain poorly understood. We examined spatiotemporal patterns of flower color and phylogenetic diversity in Eastern North American wildflowers to test for non-random community structure, seasonal shifts, and associations between flower color similarity and phylogenetic relatedness. Using occurrence, phenology, and color data from community science datasets, we reconstructed communities of co-flowering assemblages and calculated standardized effect sizes of mean pairwise distances for both flower color and phylogenetic relatedness. We analyzed seasonal trends using mixed models and assessed whether closely related species co-flowered non-randomly with respect to color similarity using bootstrap correlations. We found that, on average, co-flowering assemblages were overdispersed for both flower color and phylogeny. However, flower color dispersion significantly decreased over the growing season, while phylogenetic dispersion significantly increased, reflecting a pattern in which co-flowering assemblages shifted to more distantly related but similarly colored assemblages. Finally, color and phylogenetic dispersion were negatively correlated across communities, indicating that communities composed of more closely related species tended to exhibit more dissimilar flowers. Together, our results suggest that wildflower assemblages in Eastern North America show detectable, non-random structure across space and time with respect to color and relatedness at the broad scale, and that mechanisms underlying the structure of co-flowering groups may shift throughout the growing season.</description>
