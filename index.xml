  <description>The iridescent colors of birds originate in nanoscale feather structures that interact with light. Although the physical principles governing avian iridescence are well-established, the molecular mechanisms assembling these nanostructures into photonic materials remain unknown. Here, we investigate the genetic and developmental basis of iridescence by analyzing mutations from peafowl domestication and color variation in wild birds. We show that melanogenesis governs diverse geometric aspects of feather photonic nanostructures, enabling gains, shifts, and losses in iridescence. Mutations altering melanin composition collapse multilayered photonic systems and yield non-iridescent tissues, while alterations to melanosome abundance, elongation, or deposition timing generate multilayer architectures of variable periodicity and striking color differences. Notably, transitions from non-iridescent to iridescent plumage can arise from single-nucleotide mutations in melanogenic genes, revealing that minimal genetic change can prompt feathers to organize photonic structures. These results demonstrate that the nanoscale order underlying iridescence is developmentally plastic, emerging from physicochemical self-assembly responsive to the biochemical environment rather than from genetically encoded spatial cues. Single-cell transcriptomes from wild species further uncovered extensive melanocyte-centered regulatory rewiring associated with iridescence. Our findings identify melanogenesis as a key pathway for evolving structural coloration and illustrate how genetic programs harness self-organizing processes to generate biological diversity.</description>

  <description>Here we describe a 16-parameter, 14-color surface staining panel optimized for murine bronchoalveolar lavage cells that enables reproducible identification of major innate and adaptive immune populations relevant to pulmonary infections or other inflammatory conditions of the airways. The panel enables confident identification of neutrophils, eosinophils, B cells, T cells and subtypes, NK cells, and distinguishes between tissue resident and monocyte-derived macrophages populations. The panel was carefully designed for BAL samples that vary in cell number, are rich in debris, and often autofluorescent. Antibody concentrations are optimized to provide reproducible results regardless of sample-variable cell numbers allowing for the preparation of a single antibody cocktail master mix and rapid sample staining time, thereby cutting down on sample preparation and optimizing cell viability of analyzed samples. The panel facilitates robust cross-sectional and longitudinal comparison of airway inflammation across different airway inflammatory conditions, infections by different respiratory pathogens, impact of vaccination or therapeutics on the inflammatory landscape, and more. It facilitates hypothesis generation by revealing recruitment kinetics and remodeling of myeloid compartments, supports downstream sorting for transcriptomic or functional assays, and provides a standardized baseline for labs to adopt or extend for activation or intracellular cytokine analyses. We have successfully utilized this panel to identify differential host responses to different respiratory Mycoplasma pathogens as well as to longitudinally track the progression of inflammatory response to Mycoplasma pneumoniae over a 21-day time course study. This panel provides an economic immunophenotyping option by utilizing only 14 markers and a two laser (Blue and Violet) full spectrum cytometer to provide comprehensive immunophenotyping power of both myeloid and lymphoid cells. Furthered by lacking the requirement for advanced unmixing for sample analysis, the panel can be easily adopted by the community, enabling comparative meta-analyses of host responses across murine respiratory infection models.</description>

  <title>Rare shell colours in bivalves reveal multiple evolutionary pathways to blue and green colouration</title>

  <description>Green and blue are rare colours in bivalve shells. Where such colours occur, it is unclear whether they result from shared pigments across taxa, as similar appearances may arise from different compounds and are not necessarily homologous. Identifying their biochemical basis is therefore crucial to understanding the evolution and possible metabolic costs of these unusual traits. We used Raman spectroscopy to analyse resin-embedded cross-sections of valves from 15 bivalve species with green or blue shells. Species represented diversity in shell colour in terms of both phylogeny and morphological traits, including colour location (organic periostracum, organic layers in the calcareous shell or inorganic calcareous matrix). Green colour consistently occurred in organic layers rather than calcareous shell, while blue colour occurs in both calcareous shell and organic layers. Blue colour appears to be due to carotenoid-based pigments, similar to other pigments observed in bivalve shells. Green colour, however, is due either to novel pigments, not previously identified in mollusc shells, which are only weakly Raman active or nanostructures that produce structural colour in the absence of green pigments. Within bivalves, to date structural colour has been reported only in one genus, underscoring its evolutionary significance.</description>

  <description>Tropical pollinators forage in environments where floral resources vary in space and time, requiring flexible strategies to optimise foraging efficiency. One such strategy, floral constancy - the temporary restriction to a single flower type - strongly influences foraging success and plant-pollinator interactions. We aimed to: (1) quantify spontaneous colour preferences and constancy in the Asian giant honeybee Apis dorsata, (2) test whether reward concentration modulates these preferences, (3) evaluate how quickly learned associations override spontaneous biases, (4) determine whether bees can use multiple colour associations simultaneously, and (5) assess whether local floral spectral patterns correlate with bee preferences. Bees trained to a neutral UV-grey stimulus showed a strong spontaneous preference and high constancy to blue, revealing a robust short-wavelength bias. Crucially, the strength of this spontaneous bias depended on reward concentration; Low-reward conditions elicited strong blue constancy, whereas high-reward conditions weakened it, demonstrating that reward expectation shapes spontaneous colour choices. This bias was flexible. When bees learned that yellow was rewarding, they switched their preferences. Bees sequentially trained to both colours visited blue and yellow, showing no overall bias, or effect of the last-trained colour, indicating that recent experiences disrupt colour-specific constancy and generate largely random foraging choices. Bees were capable of learning and retaining two colours simultaneously, effectively suppressing the influence of spontaneous preferences. Finally, analysis of the community floral spectral distribution revealed a strong dominance of short-wavelength flowers, suggesting that long-term selection by the local floral environment may underlie the spontaneous blue preference observed in A. dorsata.</description>

  <title>EEG-Based Decoding of Color and Visual Category Representations Is Reliable Within and Across Sessions</title>
  <dc:creator>Frenkel, C.</dc:creator>

  <description>The human visual system represents stimuli in a rich and detailed manner. Traditional methods of studying visual representations in humans, such as event-related potentials (ERP), revealed numerous distinctions between the brain activity elicited by different categories of stimuli. However, these methods miss the information embedded in the spatial distributions of brain activity, or patterns, and are not always sensitive to study visual representations of different stimuli at the single participant or single trial level. Time-resolved multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA), or Decoding, efficiently extracts the visual representations of stimuli from the EEG topography without a-priori assumptions about the location of the effect in time and space at the single participant level. The rich information this method provides has increased its popularity dramatically in recent years. Yet, different participants show variable quality of decoding performance, and it is unclear if the accuracy of decoding is maintained within participants across multiple sessions, tasks, attentional conditions and visual features. In the current study, participants performed three visual tasks, over two sessions (1-7 days apart). We examined the correlation of decoding accuracy: within the cross-validation set, between sessions, between features (color and category) and to different measurements of the ERP signal and behavioral performance. We also examined how models generalized to different tasks and different attention conditions. We found that decoding accuracies varied substantially across participants, and that decoding accuracy was reliable within participant, over sessions, attention condition and task. This suggests the decodability behaves like an individual trait. Moreover, the spatial patterns underlying the decoding (classification weights) generalized across different tasks, attentional conditions and sessions. This suggests minimal representational drift at the resolution allowed by the EEG. We conclude that EEG decoding is a reliable method, and that visual representations are stable.</description>

  <title>An Adenine-Based Molecular Rotor as a Universal Fluorescent Nucleobase with High Brightness</title>

  <description>Chemically modified nucleic acids have become a powerful platform for basic research and applied technologies. Universal nucleobases are used in PCR,sequencing, and the design of nanodevices and aptamers. Fluorescent universal nucleobases have an even wider range of applications, including the development of nucleic acid-based sensors, switches, and relay logic gates. However, few such nucleobases have been proposed to date, and most of them have suboptimal optical properties. Here, we propose an adenine-based molecular rotor, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-6-(3-methylbenzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)adenine (oxo-AdeBZT), as a new, remarkably bright and potent fluorescent universal nucleobase. Its brightness in both oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) and DNA duplexes (4200 - 10000 M-1 * cm-1) originates from a high molar extinction coefficient (averaged 37000 M-1 * cm-1), provided by the appended 3-methylbenzo[d]thiazolyl moiety, and a relatively high quantum yield (0.11 - 0.27). Melting temperature variations observed upon the incorporation of oxo-AdeBZT opposite native nucleobases in a duplex context did not exceed 10%. The basis of these universal hybridizing properties was unveiled using computational methods. According to molecular dynamics simulations, oxo-AdeBZT pushes the opposite nucleobase out of the DNA double helix and forms multiple hydrophobic contacts with the flanking base pairs. At the same time, the rotational mobility of the bonds between the oxo-AdeBZT-constituting heterobicycles decreases, and oxo-AdeBZT adopts a planar conformation in both ODNs and their duplexes, resulting in the light-up effect. These properties make oxo-AdeBZT a promising molecular tool for analytical, biophysical and biochemical studies.</description>

  <description>Understanding whether traits evolve independently or as integrated units is central to predicting adaptive evolution. Correlated trait evolution can reflect genetic covariation, such that selection on one trait can constrain or redirect evolutionary responses in others. Here, we used artificial selection on cuticle color in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans to investigate whether color and behavior evolve in tandem. We selected for light and dark thoracic colors across 16 generations in two populations per species and measured correlated responses in a suite of behavioral traits, including aggression, basal activity, total activity, sleep, and geotaxis. Dark selected individuals generally showed higher aggression and basal activity than light selected or control flies across both species and sexes, pointing to a modest but repeatable correlated response that must be interpreted in light of low and variable aggression in our assay. In contrast, patterns for geotaxis, sleep, and total activity evolved unpredictably, often varying across species and populations, and showed no clear or uniform association with color. Taken together, our results suggest that some behaviors may share a predictable relationship with color, whereas others behave largely independently under the conditions we examined. The persistence of correlated responses in aggression and basal activity in response to selection on color is consistent with a conserved genetic basis, such as pleiotropy or tight linkage, although our data do not, by themselves, distinguish among these mechanisms. Future work that identifies the loci underlying variation in both color and behavior and tests their effects experimentally will be important for clarifying how multivariate genetic covariance shapes the direction and pace of adaptive evolution.</description>

  <description>Floral diversity is the hallmark of Angiosperms and is often shaped by pollinator-mediated selection, which drives floral divergence as plants evolve traits that attract specific pollinator groups. Mediterranean red, bowl-shaped flowers are specialized on pollination by glaphyrid beetles in areas with beetles and bees but evolved different colours and specialize on bees as pollinators when beetles are absent. What explains this geographic variation in specialization and concomitant flower colour differences? We assessed pollination effectiveness of honeybees and glaphyrids for the colour-polymorphic Anemone pavonina in its natural habitat. We recorded the duration and number of flower visits and quantified single-visit seed set. Per-visit effectiveness (relative seed set) was threefold higher for Pygopleurus (36.3%) than for honeybees (9.5%). Flower visitation lasted substantially longer for beetles (56.3 sec. on average) than for honeybees (2.3 sec.). For beetles, pollinator importance (single-visit seed set x visitation frequency) was highest at low elevations but declined with increasing elevation, whereas for bees pollinator importance remained low yet constant across the elevational gradient. The high pollinator effectiveness of beetles indicates that floral specialization for this pollinator group is advantageous, even to the point that excluding low-quality bee pollinators - by producing inconspicuous flower colours - is beneficial. Non-red flowers may only be beneficial at higher elevations, where bee pollinator importance exceeds that of beetles.</description>

  <description>Structural coloration is a physical phenomenon observed in many living organisms, including seaweeds, via the formation of highly organized nanostructures. Although a widespread system is characterized by the deposition of multilayer thin-film in the extracellular matrix (ECM), enabling light interference, to date such lamellae have only been described in the cuticle of red algae belonging to the Gigartinaceae family within macroalgae. Here, we determine the composition of the multilayered cuticle components in the model species Chondrus crispus (Rhodophyta), using genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and analytical profiling of carbohydrates. The complex structural assembly revealed common features with the ECM of animals. The carbohydrate fraction consists of a complex mixture of ECM carrageenans and glycosaminoglycan-like structures. A major von Willerbrand factor A domain (VWA) protein plays a critical role for the adhesion of macromolecules, including protein-protein interactions and to sulfated polysaccharides. We propose the name of Lamellae Cohesive Protein (LCP) regarding the alternate distribution of chemically distinct constituents within the cuticle. For the first time, we identified major proteins of the algal cuticle, providing a framework for addressing the evolutionary origins of the algal cuticle biosynthesis and raise important questions regarding its role, particularly across the life cycle marked by major structural ECM modifications.</description>

  <description>Iridosomes, the guanine crystal-forming organelles of pigment-producing iridophores, are among the most versatile, visually striking yet mechanistically uncharacterized organelles in vertebrate biology. Lysosome-related organelles (LROs) support cell type-specific functions by adapting endolysosomal pathways for specialized roles. Here, we show that iridosomes represent a previously unrecognized subtype of LROs. Using transcriptomic profiling of zebrafish iridophores, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene disruption, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, we define the molecular program underlying iridosome biogenesis. Iridosomes have evolved unique adaptations for crystal growth while retaining core features of other LROs. Key regulators, including RAB32a, AP3M2, and HPS5, are essential for crystal formation, with gene knockouts causing reduced crystal number, altered morphology, and distinct maturation defects. We further identify hallmark LRO features in iridosomes, including intraluminal vesicles and pH-regulated developmental transitions. Cross-species transcriptomic analysis confirms that iridosomes share an LRO signature across vertebrates, including teleost fish and reptiles, suggesting ancient evolutionary origins. These findings establish iridosomes as crystalline LROs and as a model for investigating how cells construct structurally specialized organelles through coordinated trafficking, acid-base regulation, and crystallization, with implications for LRO evolution and human disease.</description>

  <description>Predation is a key driver of speciation and phenotypic diversification, yet how antipredator traits evolve and persist over evolutionary time remains poorly understood. We generated target sequence capture and whole-genome sequencing data for the skipper butterfly subfamily Eudaminae (Hesperiidae) to test whether antipredator defenses, in interaction with environmental variation, promote diversification. We focus on two antipredation wing traits: hindwing tails, which deflect predator attacks, and blue-green coloration, which may enhance motion dazzle and be used as warning coloration. Applying phylogenomics, morphometrics, and comparative methods, we model trait evolution in relation to diel activity and geographic distribution and find that hindwing tails repeatedly evolved at least seven times and blue-green coloration at least fifteen times. Both traits are associated with elevated speciation rates, but evolutionary transitions toward tailless wings and non-iridescent coloration occurred more frequently than trait gains, indicating high evolutionary lability of these antipredator defenses. Trait loss, particularly pronounced in tropical diurnal species, may reflect trade-offs in flight performance, shifts in predation guilds, or the evolution of alternative defensive traits. Our findings highlight rampant convergent evolution of wing traits that are under strong predator-mediated selection. By identifying how antipredator defenses and environmental contexts influence phenotypic and species diversification, this study provides new insights into the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying insect diversity.</description>

  <title>Two-colour Imaging Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (ImFCS) probes the influence of the juxta-membrane actin-cortex</title>

  <description>Here we extend Imaging Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (ImFCS), together with bright, photostable fluorophores, to quantify how the juxta-membranous actin cortex influences plasma membrane dynamics. This problem is technically challenging because the membrane is only a few nanometres thick, whereas the axial resolution of live-cell fluorescence imaging is on the order of 100 nm. We address this by engineering a membrane-anchored actin reporter that combines a weakly interacting actin-binding domain with bright, photostable fluorophores optimized for two-colour ImFCS. This design enables the generation of simultaneous, co-registered diffusion maps where the mobility of the reporter serves as a dynamic sensor for the local density of the cortical actin network. The actin-binding reporter displays diffusion coefficients spanning more than two orders of magnitude, in stark contrast to an otherwise similar reporter that cannot bind actin, which diffuses much faster and within a much narrower range. Thus, the mobility of the reporter becomes a sensitive spatial readout of actin-mediated constraints. By comparing, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the diffusion of the actin-binding reporter with that of the non-binding mutant, we construct an actin-occupancy map that quantifies the fraction of the membrane functionally influenced by cortical actin. Using this approach, we find that the juxta-membrane actin cortex modulates transport over more than 80% of the cell surface. Our two-channel ImFCS strategy establishes diffusion-based comparison as a general methodology to map the functional footprint of the cortical cytoskeleton on live cell membranes.</description>

  <description>Understanding the architecture of biological adaptations is a major endeavor of evolutionary biology. Using Natural History collections, we study the genetic basis and evolution of white/brown winter coat color variation in the long-tailed weasel (Neogale frenata), a crucial phenological adaptation for camouflage in habitats with seasonal snow. We produced whole-genome sequencing data for museum specimens, along two winter color morph transition areas in North America, at the West and East coasts. Genome-wide association scans identified a single genomic region linked to color variation polymorphism with approximately 300kb and 200kb in the West and East regions, respectively, which included the pigmentation gene MC1R. We identified three MC1R alleles, two of which with deletions of nine or eight amino acids, alternatively associated with the winter brown morphs in the West and East, respectively. These deletions affect the second transmembrane domain, and in one case also the first extracellular loop, which in silico analyses predicted to impact the protein&#39;s function. Our findings show alternative intraspecific evolutionary solutions for environmental adaptation in long-tailed weasels, building on the evidence that major genes of the melanin production pathway are hotspots for recurrent and independent evolution of winter camouflage adaptation.</description>

  <description>1. Climate change poses extreme risks to biodiversity, threatening the ecosystems upon which humanity depends. Understanding the traits that mediate how organisms respond to climatic gradients in space and time will enable better predictions of the taxa and ecological communities most at risk from warming. 2. In insects, colouration influences thermoregulation, but warming responses must be traded off against other selective pressures. We hypothesise that butterfly wing reflectance in visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectra respond differently to temperature and ultraviolet radiation over space and time. We combined existing reflectance data of 97 butterfly species in both NIR and visible wavelengths, with long-term abundance monitoring data of 120 butterfly communities sampled across 1650 m altitude gradients from May to August in two time periods (2004/5 and 2017). 3. The visible and NIR reflectances of butterfly communities showed a non-linear relationship with altitude, with the lowest reflectance (darkest butterflies) at the coolest, highest sites. In contrast, community visible reflectance decreased through the year as temperatures warmed over spring-summer, whereas community NIR reflectance remained constant, revealing divergent responses of reflectance types to seasonal changes. Temperature had opposing effects on visible and NIR reflectance of butterfly communities, where increasing temperature reduced community visible reflectance strongly while increasing community NIR reflectance slightly. 4. Considering the effects on reflectance of shared evolutionary history in a Bayesian hierarchical model for individual species, lighter-coloured (more reflective) species were associated with warmer temperatures - flying later in spring-summer or at lower altitudes. However, instead of decreasing in reflectance through the year and across temperature gradients, species instead became lighter, we expect as a result of a Simpson&#39;s paradox. 5. These results emphasise how visible and NIR reflectance wavelength bands mediate butterflies&#39; responses to environmental gradients in distinct ways, despite being highly correlated across species. We also show that incorporating phylogeny into trait-environment models is essential; relying on traits alone would lead to incorrect inferences and predictions of taxa most at risk from warming climates.</description>

  <description>The representational structure of human color perception, particularly within vast color spaces, remains incompletely understood. While representational structures for dozens of colors have been studied, exploring structures spanning hundreds or thousands of colors has been infeasible due to the time costs of psychophysical experiments. Given these constraints, deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted attention as a promising tool for providing proxies or predictions of human perception beyond the scope of psychophysical experiments. However, it remains unclear which DNN models possess internal representations that geometrically align with human color perception. Furthermore, it is unclear which learning paradigm enables DNNs to acquire a color representation that is geometrically aligned with that of humans. Here, we systematically investigate which learning paradigm enables DNNs to produce a color representation that is structurally congruent with that of humans, with a focus on three types: self-supervised learning (SSL) that trains on images alone, supervised learning (SL) that trains on images with category labels, and contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) that trains on image-text pairs. We compared internal representations of DNNs with the human similarity judgments of 93 colors using a rigorous unsupervised method termed Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT), which reveals whether the representational structures of humans and models align at the fine-item level. Our results show that only the CLIP paradigm acquires color representations that strongly align with human data at the fine-item level. Furthermore, when we leveraged a key advantage of DNNs and investigated a substantial representational structure of 4096 colors, the human-aligned CLIP models consistently converged on a non-trivial distorted ring-like structure, which presents a plausible prediction for the large-scale human color representation. Our work demonstrates an approach for exploring unknown territories of human perception through the use of computational models validated in a limited empirical space, and provides predictions for future large-scale psychophysical experiments.</description>

  <title>Equiluminant Border Ownership Cells as a Missing Link in Color Form Perception</title>
  <dc:creator>Mehrani, P.</dc:creator>

  <description>We propose the existence of a sub-population of border ownership neurons that signal figure side along equiluminant borders, those defined purely by color contrast. We postulate that these neurons, similar to primate equiluminant V1 [26] and V4 [5] cells, are strongly activated by equiluminant contrast on their preferred side, with diminished response for strictly luminance contrast. To test this hypothesis, we propose a hierarchical and mechanistic model that explains how equiluminant border ownership signals can be achieved in the ventral stream. Our simulation results suggest that model equiluminant neurons are highly color-selective while exhibiting similar orientation and border ownership selectivity as their luminance counterparts. Additionally, our model equiluminant cells indeed exhibited the above postulated pattern of responses. We suggest that these neurons are the missing links in the equiluminance channels in the ventral stream that transform equiluminant oriented edge signals in V1 to equiluminant object-centered shape representations in V4. Our findings point to the importance of re-examining the border ownership neuron population to further detail their role in equiluminant channels in the ventral stream.</description>

  <description>Among the most interesting adult traits are those with roles in animal communication. Yet developmental mechanisms by which genes drive cell behaviors in building the final forms of such traits are rarely known. In this context, pigmentation is useful because colors and patterns often provide signals in mate choice, predation avoidance and other behaviors and pigmentation is unusually accessible to observation and manipulation. Here we focus on some of the most prominent signaling colors--red, orange and yellow--and show how BMP signaling at the cellular level allows for a very different kind of signal at the organismal level. Using pearl danio, Danio albolineatus, we find that spatially and temporally graded BMP signals promote development of yellow/orange xanthophores over red erythrophores in the fin of this species and a distantly related minnow, Tanichthys albonubes, and that conserved mechanisms, involving BMP co-receptor Rgmb, regulate differentiation of other pigment cell types in corresponding locations of zebrafish, D. rerio. We further use mutants of D. albolineatus with more red or more yellow cells than wild-type to demonstrate female responsiveness to carotenoid-based color differences between males in shoaling preference assays, and we show the existence of polygenic standing variation for this pigmentary trait. Our findings illustrate a chain of function spanning hierarchical levels and provide a deeper understanding of pigmentary form and function and its evolution.</description>

  <description>Biology&#39;s strategies for manipulating light offer rich inspiration for the design of sustainable replacements to conventional pigments in paints, coatings, and displays. For these applications, where angle-independent color is required, photonic glasses, composed of random arrangements of dielectric spheres, offer a promising solution. However, their intrinsic disorder, particularly from particle polydispersity, fundamentally limits their color saturation and practical utility. In contrast, insects like damselflies and dragonflies exhibit surprisingly vivid, non-iridescent structural colors, despite relying on disordered photonic structures. Here, we show how damselflies combine compositional and structural dispersion to overcome color saturation limits of photonic glasses. Firstly, doping transparent particles with yellow pigments dramatically enhances blue-green structural resonances by the coupled effects of narrowband absorption and refractive index (material) dispersion. Secondly, the refractive index of the nanospheres varies with their size and crystallinity. This gives rise to a &#39;structural dispersion&#39; which maintains consistent optical path lengths in polydisperse assemblies, preserving high color purity. Finally, we show how damselflies tune their structural colors during maturation by precisely modulating the size of the nanospheres. Remarkably, the tuning of particle size, refractive index and pigment loading, arises naturally during the development of the pigment cells - where the pteridine nanospheres undergo a process of densification, crystallization and metabolic maturation.</description>

  <title>Egg colour mimicry in the common cuckoo results from coevolutionary alternation, not coevolutionary arms races</title>

  <description>The exquisite eggshell mimicry found in many cuckoo-host systems has been the textbook example of a coevolutionary arms race [1]. In this system, cuckoos lay their eggs in their hosts&#39; nests leaving these foster parents to rear their young [2]. In defence, most of these hosts have evolved the ability to recognize cuckoo eggs. It is long-assumed that these interactions select for ever-improving eggshell mimicry in cuckoo host-races laying distinct eggs that specifically mimic their host&#39;s eggshell, regardless of its particular colour [3,4]. We challenge this paradigm and demonstrate that coevolutionary arms races and egg colour mimicry are the exception to the rule. Here, using eggshell reflectance spectra from 39 host species and the specific cuckoo eggs found in their nests, we show that eggshell colour mimicry is very uncommon even among frequent hosts. Although cuckoo eggs display considerable variation in eggshell colour, their hosts&#39; eggshell colours occupy 6 times their colour volume. As a result, mimicry is only achieved for a small subset of the egg colour gamut. Furthermore, cuckoo host-races rarely lay eggs that match their hosts&#39; eggs better than those of other potential hosts or that are distinct from those laid by other cuckoo host-races. These patterns are inconsistent with the long-held assumption of coevolutionary arms races, but consistent with coevolutionary alternation that is defined by a process of continual host-switching. These findings open new avenues for research in a system that has long served as a model for studying coevolutionary processes.</description>

  <description>Of all visual systems shaped over billions of years, stomatopod crustaceans or mantis shrimps possess arguably one of the most extraordinary eyes, with unmatched potential for broad colour detection (T. W. Cronin &amp; Marshall, 1989; J. Marshall &amp; Oberwinkler, 1999; J. Marshall et al., 2007). Yet how their unusual diversity of visual opsins (Porter et al., 2020) maps onto functional spectral sensitivities (Streets et al., 2022; T. W. Cronin et al., 2022) has remained unresolved. Here, we uncover the molecular rhodopsin-based physiological mechanisms of spectral tuning and show that seventeen opsins, mostly from the colour-sensing midband of the Neogonodactylus oerstedii eye, exhibit distinct spectral absorption ranges and couple to Gq- or Gi-proteins. Two mid-wavelength opsins (NOMs) preferentially absorb blue light, while twelve long-wavelength opsins (NOLs) absorb in the green range. In addition, three NOLs are red-sensitive beyond 600 nm, representing the most far-red-sensitive opsins functionally characterized in animals. Several opsins exhibit photoreversibility with inverse blue-red spectral shifts, revealing an unrecognised layer of photochemical flexibility in stomatopod photoreception. Combined with ommatidial carotenoid filters, our mechanistic model shows how individually tuned rhodopsins shape row-specific spectral sensitivity across the eye, promoting far-red sensitivity in tier 3P in relation to other spectral wavelengths. These specialised rhodopsin-filter combinations collectively enable robust colour vision along a broad light spectrum and across dim and bright conditions, offering new insights into the evolution of one of Natures most sophisticated visual systems.</description>
