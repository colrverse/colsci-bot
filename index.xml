  <description>Brain inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD). Glucose hypometabolism and glial activation are pathological features seen in AD brains; however, the connection between the two is not fully understood. Using a Drosophila model of AD, we identified that glucose metabolism in glia plays a critical role in neuroinflammation under disease conditions. Expression of human tau in the retinal cells, including photoreceptor neurons and pigment glia, causes photoreceptor degeneration accompanied by inclusion formation and swelling of lamina glial cells. We found that inclusions are formed by glial phagocytosis, and swelling of the laminal cortex correlates with the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Co-expression of human glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) with tau in the retina does not affect tau levels but suppresses these inflammatory responses and photoreceptor degeneration. We also found that expression of GLUT3, specifically in the pigment glia, is sufficient to suppress inflammatory phenotypes and mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in the tau-expressing retina. Our results suggest that glial glucose metabolism contributes to inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration in tauopathy.</description>

  <description>Animal communication can be complex, often involving multiple static and dynamic traits. The extent to which these traits are correlated can elucidate their function as either redundant or multiple messages. Using the agamid lizard, Psammophilus dorsalis, as a model system we examined patterns of trait expression and the role of steroid hormones in mediating these traits during social interactions. We staged male-male interactions in the lab and measured the repertoire of display behaviour and colours, which change dynamically in the visible and ultraviolet ranges in different body regions. Additionally, we measured testosterone and corticosterone levels before and after the social trials. Our results show that within behaviour and colour trait categories, components were strongly correlated within individuals, suggesting either a shared physiological pathway or redundant information content. However, across trait categories, correlation patterns varied. The chromatic contrast of the (yellow) dorsal region of lizards was correlated with both body size and level of aggression, whereas the size of UV patches was correlated with body size only. We also found a negative association between baseline corticosterone levels, body size and dorsal yellow chromatic contrast, suggesting a mechanistic link between these traits. However, social interaction induced testosterone and corticosterone levels were uncorrelated with the expression of the dynamic behavioural and colour displays during the social interactions itself. Notably, the intensity of colour and behavioural displays of males were matched by their opponents. Overall, our results suggest that multiple signalling traits can ensure both redundancy as well as provide multiple messages to receivers, thus improving the robustness of information transfer, particularly during competitions which have high fitness consequences.</description>

  <description>Animal colouration is fundamentally important for social communication within conspecifics to advertising threat to competitors or fitness to possible mates. Social status and animal colouration are covarying traits that are plastic in response to dynamic environments. In the African cichlid, Astatotilapia burtoni, body colouration and behaviour have been extensively reported to vary with social rank. However, the nature of the interaction between these two traits is poorly understood. We hypothesise that pigmentation patterns could be linked to the behavioural repertoires underlying social status and can be resolved to regions on the cichlid body plan. To test this hypothesis, we generated Territorial (T) and Non-territorial (NT) males and employed computer vision tools to quantify and visualise patterns/colour enrichment associated with stereotyped T/NT male behaviour. We report colour-behaviour interactions localised in specific areas of the body and face for two colour morphs, illustrating a more nuanced view of social behaviour and pigmentation. Since behavioural and morphological variation are key drivers of selection in the East African Great Rift Lakes, we surmise our data may be translatable to other cichlid lineages and underline the importance of trait covariance in sexual selection and male competition.</description>

  <title>Damsels in a hidden colour: development of ultraviolet sensitivity and colour patterns in damselfishes (Pomacentridae)</title>

  <description>Damselfishes (Pomacentridae) are widespread and highly abundant on tropical coral reefs. They exhibit diverse body colouration within and between the ~250 species and across ontogenetic stages. In addition to human visible colours (i.e., 400-700 nm), most adult damselfishes reflect ultraviolet (UV, 300-400 nm) colour patches. UV sensitivity and UV colour signals are essential for feeding and form the basis for a secret communication channel invisible to the many UV-blind predatory fish on the reef; however, how these traits develop across ontogenetic stages, and their distribution across the damselfish family is poorly characterised. Here, we used UV photography, phylogenetic reconstructions of opsin genes, differential gene expression analysis (DGE) of retinal samples, to investigate the development of UV vision and colour patterns in three ontogenetic stages (pre-settlement larval, juvenile, and adult) of eleven damselfish species. Using DGE, we found similar gene expression between juveniles and adults, which strongly differed from larvae. All species and all stages expressed at least one UV-sensitive sws1 opsin gene. However, UV body colour patterns only started to appear at the juvenile stage. Moreover, Pomacentrus species displayed highly complex UV body patterns that were correlated with the expression of two sws1 copies. This could mean that some damselfishes can discriminate colours that change only in their UV component. We demonstrate dramatic shifts in both UV sensitivity and UV colouration across the development stages of damselfish, while highlighting the importance of considering ontogeny when studying the coevolution of visual systems and colour signals.</description>

  <description>The calcitonin (CT) family of related peptides exert their diverse physiological effects in mammals via two G-protein coupled receptors, CTR and the CTR-like receptor CLR. Analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of CT-type signaling has revealed the occurrence of CT-type peptides and CTR/CLR-type proteins in deuterostome and protostome invertebrates. Furthermore, experimental studies have revealed that in the protostome Drosophila melanogaster the CT-like peptide DH31 can act as a ligand for a CTR/CLR-type receptor and a pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) receptor. Here we investigated the signaling mechanisms and functions of CT-type neuropeptides in a deuterostome invertebrate, the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (phylum Echinodermata). In A. japonicus, a single gene encodes two CT-type peptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2), both of which act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor (AjCTR) and two PDF-type receptors (AjPDFR1, AjPDFR2), but with differential activation of downstream cAMP/PKA, Gq/Ca2+/PKC and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Analysis of the expression of the gene encoding AjCT1 and AjCT2 revealed transcripts in a variety of organ systems, but with highest expression in the circumoral nervous system. In vitro pharmacological experiments revealed that AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 cause dose-dependent relaxation of longitudinal body wall muscle and intestine preparations. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacological experiments and loss-of-function tests revealed a potential physiological role for AjCT2 signaling in promoting feeding and growth in A. japonicus. This is the first study to obtain evidence that CT-type peptides can act as ligands for both CTR/CLR-type and PDF-type receptors in a deuterostome. Furthermore, because of the economic importance of A. japonicus as a foodstuff, discovery of the potential role for CT-type peptides as regulators of feeding and growth in this species may provide a basis for practical applications in aquaculture.</description>

  <description>The relationships between facial expression and color affect human cognition functions such as perception and memory. However, whether these relationships influence attention remains unclear. Additionally, whether facial expressions affect selective attention is unknown; for example, reddish angry faces increase negative social evaluation or emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether selective attention is similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 amplitudes for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, there was no significant main effect or interaction effect of facial expression or facial color on P1 amplitudes for the target, and there were significant main effects of facial expression only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the intensity of a human&#39;s selective attention to facial expressions varies according to the higher-order semantic processing of the relationship between emotion and color rather than simple facial expression or facial color effects individually. Our results support the idea that red color increases the human response to anger from an EEG perspective.</description>

  <description>Daily rhythms in mosquito attraction to humans are thought to drive biting patterns and contribute to disease transmission dynamics. Behavioral rhythms in many insects are controlled by specialized clock cells in the brain that are coordinated by the neuropeptide Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF). We show that female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with genetically disrupted PDF display altered daily behavioral timing with reduced locomotor activity and biting in the morning. Using an automated behavioral tracking system, we also report that mosquitoes exhibit daily modulation of response persistence to the host cue carbon dioxide and loss of PDF alters this pattern. These findings indicate that PDF regulates temporal features of host-seeking behavior that promote biting success at specific times of day and may underlie blood feeding patterns observed in the field.</description>

  <description>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is widely used as a technique for materials characterization. It has also been successfully applied to the imaging of biological samples, providing invaluable insights into the topography, morphology and composition of biological structures. A particular method combining different SEM detectors, named Density-Dependent Coloured SEM (DDC-SEM), has proven to be most useful for the identification and visualization of minerals in soft tissues. The method consists of a manipulation of original greyscale SEM images to produce coloured images that provide both topography and density information for samples with components of different densities. Here we provide a discussion on how to use DDC-SEM to aid the visualization and intuitive understanding of pathological calcification. This method has become popular not only for its scientific improvement of conventional SEM greyscale images, but also for its aesthetical merits.</description>

  <description>The pantropical family Annonaceae possesses a broad array of floral phenotypes and pollination specialisations. Being the most species-rich lineage in the magnoliids, Annonaceae are a major flowering plant component of tropical rainforests, and are important in the plant-pollinator network of this biome. Insects such as beetles, flies, bees, cockroaches and thrips have been reported as their pollinators. Although there has been considerable effort to assess their interactions with pollinators, attempts to characterise the visual and olfactory communication channels between them are scarce. Here, we report the floral phenology and characterise the spectral reflectance and odour of 12 Annonaceae species from five genera, viz. Meiogyne, Monoon, Polyalthia, Pseuduvaria, and Uvaria. Pseuduvaria species are either monoecious or dioecious while the four genera produce hermaphroditic flowers. The Meiogyne species are likely pollinated by small beetles; the Polyalthia and Pseuduvaria species are likely pollinated by both beetles and flies; and the Uvaria species is likely pollinated by both beetles and bees. All species produce flowers that are not reflective in the 300-350 nm UV spectrum, and have various spectral reflectance profile across the remaining UV and visible spectra. We detected diverse floral volatiles across all the species assessed. The flowers of the small beetle-pollinated species, including Meiogyne species and Polyalthia xanthocarpa, emitted mostly branched-chain esters, including isobutyl acetate and isoamyl acetate. The Pseuduvaria species emitted scent reminiscent of rotten fruit, largely consisting of 2,3-butanediol, a common by-product in yeast fermentation. The flowers of Uvaria concava, which were visited by both bees and beetles, released mainly straight-chain esters, including methyl hexanoate and methyl (Z)-4-octenoate. A corrugated inner petal outgrowth was observed in Meiogyne and Pseuduvaria; this functions as a food body reward in Meiogyne, but as a nectary gland for Pseuduvaria. This study provides insights into how Annonaceae flowers attract different guilds of pollinators.</description>

  <title>Pollinator visitation pattern and differential reproductive compatibilities maintain bract colour polymorphism in a nocturnal ginger from Western Ghats, India</title>

  <description>Polymorphism, the presence of discrete floral morphs within a population, can be maintained by positive or negative frequency selection. Pollinators often show a positive frequency-dependent foraging which confers reproductive advantage to common morphs over rare morphs. However, pollinator-mediated selections often act on visual floral displays. Here, we investigate hawkmoth-mediated selection in a nocturnal Curcuma caulina (Zingiberaceae) with bract colour polymorphism, where the role of visual display is minimal. We used path analyses to explain maintenance of differential morph abundances in C. caulina. For this, we quantified inter-morph trait variations in floral structures, nectar traits, pollinator visitations, physiological compatibilities and reproductive fitness. We noted that the rarest morph was self-compatible, exhibited higher nectar reward and pollinator visits, and low reproductive fitness, whereas the two common morphs were complete to partially self-incompatible, with lower nectar rewards and pollinator visits, but higher reproductive fitness. We conclude that while hawkmoths show a positive response to floral rewards, self-compatibility confers lower reproductive fitness to the nectar-rich rare morphs. In contrast, self-incompatibility confers higher fitness to the common morphs despite lower pollinator visits. Thus, colour polymorphism in nocturnal C. caulina is explained by floral traits associated with bract colour, which are under pollinator-mediated selection.</description>

  <description>Carbon flux to the deep sea can be dictated by surface ocean phytoplankton community composition, but translating surface ocean observations into quantitative predictions of carbon export requires additional consideration of the underlying ecosystem drivers. Here, we used genetic tracers of phytoplankton detected in surface seawater and within sinking particles collected in the mesopelagic ocean to identify mechanistic links between surface communities and carbon export in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Phytoplankton 18S rRNA sequences were sampled over a one-month period in surface seawater and within bulk-collected and individually-isolated sinking particles using mesopelagic sediment traps (100-500m). Nearly all phytoplankton amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) exported from the surface were packaged in large (&gt;300 m) particles. Individually, these particles contained only a few distinct phytoplankton ASVs, but collectively, large particles transported about half of the surface taxonomic diversity into the mesopelagic. The relative sequence abundances of the surface community detected within particles were quantitatively related to measured POC fluxes: a linear model based on the relative sequence abundance of just two pigment-based phytoplankton taxa, diatoms and photosynthetic Hacrobia, was predictive of POC flux magnitude. These two taxa were also enriched within the ecologically-distinct particle classes that had the greatest influence on carbon export magnitude. As global, hyperspectral ocean color satellites begin to quantify these taxonomic groups in the surface ocean, the relationship of these taxa to carbon fluxes demonstrated here may help generate more accurate global estimates of export.</description>

  <description>Fireflies use bioluminescent signals to communicate with their mates. Luciferase has been thought to be the sole contributor to light color; however, populations of the Photinus pyralis firefly display variation in the color of their emitted signals yet have identical luciferase sequences. Here, we examined whether pigments could be present in the light organs of the twilight-active species P. pyralis and contribute to this variation. We detected patterns of expression that suggest ommochrome and pterin screening pigments are expressed in P. pyralis light organs and could filter light emitted by luciferase and play a role in signal tuning. There were no significant differences between the pigment gene expression of P. pyralis individuals with yellower and greener signals. Our study provides alternative mechanisms that could influence pigments in P. pyralis light organs that could also play a role in modifying signal color.</description>

  <description>The radiation of angiosperms is marked by a phenomenal diversity of floral size, shape, color, scent, and reward. Through hundreds of years of documentation and quantification scientists have sought to make sense of this variation by defining pollination syndromes as the convergent evolution of common suits of floral traits across distantly related species that have evolved by selection to optimize pollination strategies. Now, with the rise in popularity of community science platforms like iNaturalist, anyone - not just scientists - can collect data. Thanks to the availability of high-quality community-science datasets, we have an unprecedented number of observations of natural flowering plant diversity. These datasets provide an opportunity to develop new tools and to examine new traits, such as flowering time, that may help further characterize pollination syndromes. Here we test the hypothesis that flowering phenology can also be an important trait of a pollination syndrome; particularly of the &quot;hummingbird flower&quot; syndrome, which is usually characterized by red color, long corolla tubes, and exserted stamens. We produced a novel flower color dataset by using GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V) to assign flower color to 11,729 North American flowering plant species from community science photographs. We then mapped those species-specific colors to 1,674,908 citizen scientist observations of flowering plants. We demonstrate constrained flowering time in the eastern U.S. for species with red or orange flowers relative to species with flowers of other colors. Importantly, the onset of flowering corresponds closely to the arrival of hummingbirds. Our findings reveal an opportunity to expand the suite of traits included in pollination syndrome and suggest that the hummingbird pollination syndrome can include flowering phenology. Our methods demonstrate an effective pipeline for leveraging the enormous amount of community science data by extracting valuable information about patterns of trait variation.</description>

  <description>Color vision assessment is essential in clinical practice, yet different tests exhibit distinct strengths and limitations. Here we apply a psychophysical paradigm, Angular Indication Measurement (AIM) for color detection and discrimination. AIM is designed to address some of the shortcomings of existing tests, such as prolonged testing time, limited accuracy and sensitivity, and the necessity for clinician oversight. AIM presents adaptively generated charts, each a N*M (here 4*4) grid of stimuli, and participants are instructed to indicate either the orientation of the gap in a cone-isolating Landolt C optotype or the orientation of the edge between two colors in an equiluminant color space. The contrasts or color differences of the stimuli are adaptively selected for each chart based on performance of prior AIM charts. In a group of 23 color-normal and 15 people with color vision deficiency (CVD), we validate AIM color against Hardy-Rand-Rittler (HRR), Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test (FM100), and anomaloscope color matching diagnosis and use machine learning techniques to classify the type and severity of CVD. The results show that AIM has classification accuracies comparable to that of the anomaloscope, and while HRR and FM100 are less accurate than AIM and an anomaloscope, HRR is very rapid. We conclude that AIM is a computer-based, self-administered, response-adaptive and rapid tool with high test-retest repeatability that has the potential to be suitable for both clinical and research applications.</description>

  <description>The mining of genomes across life has unearthed a bounty of biosynthetic potential to diverse molecules key to a biobased future. While the heterologous expression of metabolic pathways has achieved broad success, most approaches suffer a similar fate in low initial production levels that require extensive, resource-heavy iterative strain engineering refinement. Herein we introduce a growth-coupled biosynthetic (GrowBio) strategy that irrevocably connects microbial growth with specialized compound production. We demonstrate the plug-and-play versatility of GrowBio in the production of the structurally complex animal biopigment xanthommatin, a color-changing ommochrome with material and cosmetic potential. Xanthommatin biosynthesis directly fuels growth of a newly designed Pseudomonas putida 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate auxotroph (PUMA). Aided by genome-scale metabolic modeling, PUMA was designed and built to be controlled by endogenous formate co-produced as a coupled biosynthetic byproduct in the multistep conversion of tryptophan to xanthommatin. Adaptive laboratory evolution was utilized to streamline xanthommatin&#39;s gram-scale bioproduction via growth rate selection, establishing GrowBio as a promising biotechnological approach for establishing and optimizing the microbial production of value-added molecules.</description>

  <description>Lignin is a crucial component of the cell wall, providing mechanical support and protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. However, little is known about wheat lignin-related mutants and their roles in pathogen defense. In this study, we identified an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-derived Aegilops tauschii mutant named brown glume and internode 1 (bgi1), which exhibits reddish-brown pigmentation in various tissues, including internodes, spikes, and glumes. Using map-based cloning and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, we identified AET6Gv20438400 (BGI1) as the leading candidate gene, encoding the TaCAD1 protein. The mutation occurred in the splice acceptor site of the first intron, resulting in a premature stop codon in BGI1. We validated the function of BGI1 using loss-of-function EMS and gene editing knockout mutants, both of which displayed reddish-brown pigmentation in lignified tissues. BGI1 knockout mutants exhibited reduced lignin content and shearing force relative to wild type, while BGI1 overexpression transgenic plants showed increased lignin content and enhanced disease resistance against common root rot and Fusarium crown rot. We confirmed that BGI1 exhibits CAD activity both in vitro and in vivo, playing an important role in lignin biosynthesis. BGI1 was highly expressed in the stem and spike and localized in the cytoplasm. Transcriptome analysis revealed the regulatory networks associated with BGI1. Finally, we demonstrated that BGI1 interacts with TaPYL-1D, potentially involved in the abscisic acid signaling pathway. The identification and functional characterization of BGI1 significantly advance our understanding of CAD proteins in lignin biosynthesis and plant defense against pathogen infection in wheat.</description>

  <description>There is high demand for microbial pigments as promising alternative for synthetic pigments basically for safety and economic reasons. This study aimed at the optimization of yellowish-orange pigment production by Exiguobacterium aurantiacum using agro-waste extract as growth substrate. Air samples were collected using depositional method. Pure cultures of pigment producing bacteria were isolated by subsequent culturing on fresh nutrient agar medium and the potent isolate was identified using MALDI-TOF technique. Culture conditions were screened using Plackett-Burman design and the most three significant variables were optimized by response surface methodology. Fermentation was conducted in 150 mL agro-waste decoctions from which tomato waste extract was selected because of higher optical density of the culture compared to other agro-waste extracts. Pigment was extracted by solvent extraction method and the best solvent was selected based on its ability to dissolve the culture suspension. The pigment was characterized using spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. Culture agitation rate, initial medium pH and concentration of yeast extract were identified as the most significant (p&lt; 0.0001) variables affecting pigment production. At optimized conditions, 0.96 g/L of pigment was extracted from 4.73 g/L of culture biomass and the extracted pigment under optimized conditions was 1.6 times higher than the pigment extracted under un-optimized conditions. The spectroscopic and chromatographic analyses demonstrated the presence of different functional groups and carotenoids were identified as parts of the molecule responsible for the yellowish-orange pigmentation of the extract. This study demonstrated the potential for optimization of pigment production by bacteria using agro-waste extract as substrate. Hence, the current findings strongly encourage for further study at a large-scale level for industrial production.</description>

  <description>The face is a uniquely distinctive stimulus for humans, encapsulating a wealth of information. Among the myriad of social cues conveyed by the face, emotional signals, known as facial expressions, are paramount not only for humans but also for numerous social animals. The evolution of facial expressions in these animals can also manifest in taxa other than mammals, as suggested by various studies highlighting the socio-ecological benefits of facial expressions. In this study, we elucidated the social function of facial coloration, determined by melanophores, in the neotropical social cichlid Symphysodon aequifasciatus. In this species, facial coloration exhibits flexibility and instantaneous changes in response to varying social contexts. Through behavioral observations and experimental manipulation, we confirmed that facial coloration in S. aequifasciatus serves to attenuate unnecessary aggressive competition among conspecifics. Furthermore, we observed that the facial area subjected to coloration in this species is innervated by the adenosine triphosphate- and noradrenaline-ergic nervous system. These findings indicated that facial expression in S. aequifasciatus depends on the sympathetic nervous system and has evolved independently of mammalian facial expressions. Our study highlights teleost fishes as valuable animal models for exploring the universality of facial expressions and their underlying cognitive mechanisms in vertebrates.</description>

  <description>There is a long tradition of using heritable color polymorphisms in natural populations to study selection, gene flow, and other evolutionary processes. However, we still have only limited knowledge on how continuous color variation within genetically discrete morphs affects selective dynamics, which narrows our understanding of how color polymorphisms persist. Our comprehensive analysis of 43 years of plumage color scores from a bi-morphic Finnish population of tawny owls (Strix aluco) reveals that intra-morph variation is substantial, but also unexpectedly dynamic. We show that both morphs recently diverged in their plumage coloration: while the brown morph is on a steady trajectory toward more intense plumage pigmentation, the gray morph has recently shifted toward lighter plumage, following a series of extreme winters. Evidence suggests that this divergence is driven by the brown morph&#39;s higher reproductive success and greater plasticity in response to seasonality, while the gray morph, with its more genetically determined plumage color and limited standing variation, has a reduced capacity to respond to selection and track new phenotypic optima. Our study confirms the presence of substantial and dynamic phenotypic variation within genetically discrete color morphs, and demonstrates its relevance for the evolutionary potential of populations to respond to environmental change.</description>

  <description>We quantified the relative effect of plasticity and heritability on Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) leaf reflectance using clonal replicates propagated from 16 populations and grown across three common gardens spanning a mean annual temperature gradient of 10.7-22.3{degrees}C. We used variance partitioning to decompose phenotypic variation expressed in the leaf spectra into genotypic versus environmental components and estimate broad-sense heritability and found that heritability was most strongly expressed in the red-edge (~680-750nm) and SWIR (~1400-3000nm). Support vector machine models predicted P. fremontii source population and garden location at 78% and 93% accuracy, respectively, demonstrating that genotypic and environmental variation can be differentiated from the same leaf spectra. However, model accuracy declined by ~49% when using leaf reflectance from any two common gardens to predict the source population at the third site. Prediction accuracies were lowest for the hottest site, which was linked to leaf stress responses in the visible and red-edge wavelengths (400-750nm). We conclude that leaf spectra display heritability and plasticity across different parts of the spectrum. When mapping in regions/seasons with extreme climates, spectral plasticity linked to heat stress can decrease spectral heritability but may offer opportunities to understand phenological responses to extreme temperatures at large scales.</description>
