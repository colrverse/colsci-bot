  description: Anthocyanins play diverse roles in plants, including attracting pollinators
    and protecting cells from oxidative damage. In zoysiagrass, a warm season turfgrass,
    their accumulation in seed heads and stolons can decrease the aesthetic appeal.
    In this study, a high-density genetic map with ~8000 single nucleotide polymorphism
    (SNP) markers organized into 20 linkage groups was generated in a Zoysia japonica
    acc. Meyer x Zoysia matrella acc. PI 231146 F2 population. Using this genetic
    map, a large-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) for anthocyanin variation in
    stolons and seed heads was mapped to chromosome 12 (PP locus). Variant analysis
    of a candidate gene for PP, Zjn_sc00004.1.g07010.1.sm.mk, which encodes a MYC-bHLH
    transcription factor that regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis, revealed a SNP at
    an exon-intron boundary in Meyer that led to intron retention. Interestingly,
    an F1 population derived from the same parents segregated for seed head color
    but uniformly displayed purple stolons. Seed head color in the F1 population co-mapped
    with the PP locus which, combined with genotypic and yeast two-hybrid analyses,
    revealed that a SNP in PI 231146 leading to an Ala163Ser substitution in the MYB-interacting
    N-terminal domain of the same MYC-bHLH transcription factor was likely causal.
    The Ala163Ser substitution affected interaction of MYC-bHLH with MYB in a MYB-dependent
    manner. The identified mutations can be exploited to develop cultivars with green
    seed heads and stolons. The high-marker-density interspecific Z. japonica x Z.
    matrella F2 genetic map also provides a robust tool for identifying genomic regions
    and genes of agronomic interest that differentiate the two species.

  description: How ecological pressures shape phenotypic traits such as colouration
    and morphology is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Colouration
    often mediates functions such as communication, camouflage, and species recognition,
    while morphological traits influence locomotion, feeding, and habitat use. In
    reef fishes, both traits exhibit striking diversity, frequently shaped by ecological
    interactions. The damselfish family (Pomacentridae) exemplifies this variation,
    displaying a wide range of colouration, morphology, and ecological strategies,
    including dietary specialisation, mutualistic behaviours, and freshwater tolerance.
    In this study, we examined 342 Pomacentridae species using an integrative framework
    that combined colouration and morphometric analyses, ancestral state reconstructions
    of habitat, diet, and symbiosis, and Phylogenetic Comparative Methods (PCMs).
    Our goal was to assess how ecological factors have influenced the evolution of
    phenotypic traits and to identify patterns of convergence linked to ecological
    specialisation. We found repeated convergent evolution in both colouration and
    body shape, often associated with similar ecological pressures. Species with specialised
    diets exhibited consistent morphological adaptations, underscoring the role of
    trophic ecology in shaping body form. Additionally, we observed a strong association
    between habitat type and dominant colouration patterns, consistent with a camouflage
    function. These findings clarify the evolutionary processes driving phenotypic
    diversity in damselfishes and highlight the importance of ecological adaptation
    in shaping both morphology and colouration. Our work contributes to a broader
    understanding of how form and function evolve in response to ecological pressures
    in coral reef ecosystems.

  description: Retinal degeneration is a leading cause of blindness and a significant
    health burden during aging worldwide. Because of its complex pathogenic mechanisms,
    however, effective interventions applicable to multiple retinal degenerations
    remain limited. Excessive microglia-mediated inflammation is a common pathological
    feature of different retinal degenerative diseases, and inhibiting these overactive
    inflammatory responses by reprogramming microglia may provide a therapeutic strategy
    with broad-spectrum potential. Here, we uncover a novel retinal pigment epithelium
    (RPE) homeostatic signal, PD-L1, that drives the reprogramming of activated microglial
    toward a retinal-protective phenotype. Using multiple analyses, including gene
    expression profiling bioinformatics, adeno-associated virus-mediated RPE-specific
    gene overexpression, pharmacological, and genetic manipulations, we show that
    RPE cells upregulate the expression of PD-L1 to modulate microglia for protection
    against retinal degeneration in an experimental dry AMD mouse model. Bioinformatics
    enrichment analysis of the high-expression gene signatures of subretinal microglia
    in AMD patients, combined with pharmacological blocking of NF-{kappa}B activity
    or using Nlrp3 knockout mice, show that PD-L1/PD-1 signaling suppresses NF-{kappa}B
    activation in microglia, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome priming and attenuating
    microglia-mediated excessive inflammation. Furthermore, the overexpression of
    PD-L1 by the AAV8 virus exerts similar microglial reprogramming and retinal protective
    effects to alleviate retinal degeneration in a preclinical model of retinitis
    pigmentosa. These findings reveal that RPE-derived PD-L1 suppresses inflammatory
    reprogramming of subretinal microglia and mitigates retinal degeneration, highlighting
    a promising proof of concept for PD-L1 as a potential therapeutic target for the
    broad treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.

  description: 'rs12913832, a polymorphism located in an enhancer within the HERC2
    gene, which is known to regulate OCA2 transcription, is heavily relied upon as
    a predictor of light versus dark eyes. Individuals with the GG genotype are projected
    to have blue eyes, while individuals with the AA or AG genotypes are projected
    to have darker eye colours (primarily brown). However, eye colour is a polygenic
    trait, and previous studies have revealed that a significant proportion of individuals
    self-report an eye colour that is not concordant with their genotype at rs12913832.
    Herein, we address the question: What common markers are influencing eye colour
    in individuals whose self-reported phenotype does not correspond to the expected
    phenotype based on their rs12913832 genotype. Building upon our prior investigation
    of iris pigmentation genetics in individuals with an expected "blue eye" background
    (rs12913832:GG genotype) in a sample of the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrows
    Health (CanPath) cohort, this study extends the analysis to include individuals
    with an expected "brown eye" background (rs12913832:AA+AG). We identified variants
    in SLC45A2, TYRP1, TYR, SLC24A4 and TSPAN10, which may influence eye colour presentation
    in individuals with the rs12913832:GG genotype and variants in IRF4, TYRP1 and
    OCA2, which may influence eye colour presentation in individuals with the rs12913832:AA+AG
    genotype. These markers include well-known pigmentation-associated single nucleotide
    polymorphisms, such as rs16891982 (SLC45A2), rs1126809 (TYR), rs12203592 (IRF4),
    rs1800407 (OCA2) and rs6420484 (TSPAN10). Several of these loci were replicated
    using independent quantitative eye colour measures, including heterochromia and
    CIELAB colour dimensions. This research highlights the importance of gene-gene
    interactions and the polygenic nature of pigmentation traits, emphasizing modifying
    effects that can sometimes counteract the dominant influence of rs12913832, contributing
    to advancements in pigmentation genetics and forensic applications.'

  description: Super-resolution fluorescence imaging enables visualization of subcellular
    structures and molecular interactions at the nanoscale, but its broader application
    has been hindered by long-standing limitations in current protein tagging systems,
    including rapid photobleaching, tag-induced artifacts, poor post-fixation labeling
    efficiency, and restricted multiplexing capability. Here, we present FLEXTAG (Fluorescent
    Labeling for Exchangeable, X-resilient Tagging in Advanced Generic Nanoscopy),
    a comprehensive protein labeling system comprising three orthogonal, ultrasmall
    (12-18 kDa), and self-renewable protein tags that collectively overcome these
    major limitations of existing tagging systems, enabling optimized multi-color
    super-resolution imaging. Through continuous exchange of organic fluorophores,
    FLEXTAG supports unprecedented durations of high-resolution imaging in both live
    and fixed cells with minimal photobleaching. It is compatible with major super-resolution
    modalities, such as SIM, STED, STORM, and PAINT, and is applicable to a wide range
    of subcellar targets. To further address fixation-induced labeling inefficiency
    and background fluorescence, we developed a novel protection-based fixation method
    and chemical blocking strategies that significantly preserve tag accessibility
    and enhance signal-to-noise ratio, improvements that are broadly applicable to
    other protein tagging systems. Altogether, FLEXTAG enables long-term tracking
    of dynamic behaviors and interactions of subcellular targets, as well as mapping
    of nanoscale protein organizations and cellular architecture, advancing both basic
    research and translational applications in cell biology.

  description: The Zika virus (ZIKV), a pathogenic member of the orthoflavivirus family,
    is raising serious health concerns worldwide. Like Dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya
    (CHIKV) viruses, it is one of the arboviruses that poses an emerging threat to
    areas where its main vectors, Aedes mosquitoes, proliferate, well beyond tropical
    and subtropical regions. Although often asymptomatic or mild, ZIKV infection has
    been responsible for a worrying increase in serious congenital syndromes, including
    microcephaly. The ability of ZIKV to be transmitted sexually and its long persistence
    in body fluids suggests its incomplete clearance in particular tissues, linked
    to recurrent infection. Among its clinical presentations, ZIKV infection has been
    associated with ocular complications, including maculopathy, retinopathy, uveitis,
    and optic neuropathy, which can lead to lasting visual impairment. The blood-retinal
    barrier (BRB), primarily composed of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and endothelial
    cells, plays a crucial role in shielding the retina from pathogens. Its disruption
    has been linked to viral retinal infections. In vitro monitoring of infection
    on hTERT RPE-1 cells revealed an ability of ZIKV to persist for up to 30 days
    in nearly 10% of the cells. This prolonged infection was marked by low cytopathic
    effects but notable morphological changes throughout the cell layer, suggestive
    of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Long-lasting viral replication
    and production was associated with reduced expression of epithelial genes and
    increased expression of certain mesenchymal genes, suggesting that integrity of
    the RPE layer may be compromised. These results indicate that viral persistence
    and phenotypical transition observed in vitro in RPE cells could provide clues
    to understanding the late onset of ocular pathophysiological manifestations in
    Zika virus-related diseases.

  description: Discrimination thresholds reveal the limits of human perception; scientists
    have studied them since the time of Fechner in the 1800s. Forced-choice psychophysical
    methods combined with the method of constant stimuli or parametric adaptive trial-placement
    procedures are well-suited for measuring one-dimensional psychometric functions.
    However, extending these methods to characterize psychometric fields in higher-dimensional
    stimulus spaces, such as three-dimensional color space, poses a significant challenge.
    Here, we introduce a novel Wishart Process Psychophysical Model (WPPM) that leverages
    the smooth variation of threshold across stimulus space. We demonstrate the use
    of the WPPM in conjunction with a non-parametric adaptive trial-placement procedure
    by characterizing the full psychophysical field for color discrimination in the
    isoluminant plane. Each participant (N = 8) completed between 6,000 and 6,466
    three-alternative forced-choice (3AFC) oddity color discrimination trials. The
    WPPM was fit to these trials. Importantly, once fit, the WPPM allows readout of
    discrimination performance between any pair of stimuli, providing a comprehensive
    characterization of the psychometric field. In addition, the WPPM readouts were
    validated for each participant by comparison with 25 probe psychometric functions.
    These were measured with an additional 6,000 trials per participant that were
    held out from the WPPM fit. The dataset offers a foundational resource for developing
    perceptual color metrics and for benchmarking mechanistic models of color processing.
    This approach is broadly generalizable to other perceptual domains beyond color.

  description: An independent evaluation of the spectroscopic properties, cellular
    performance, merits and pitfalls of the red fluorescent protein mScarlet3-H as
    compared to mScarlet3 is reported. mScarlet3-H was generated from mScarlet3 by
    a single M163H mutation. Purified mScarlet3-H is characterized by a molar coefficient
    of 79,040 M-1cm-1, a fluorescence quantum yield of 17.8%, molecular brightness
    of 14.1 and a heterogeneous multiexponential decay with an average fluorescence
    lifetime of 1 ns. Evaluation in living mammalian cells revealed a comparable maturation
    speed and efficiency of mScarlet3 and mScarlet3-H, but the overall cellular brightness
    of mScarlet3-H was 5-fold lower than that of mScarlet3. Photobleaching analysis
    in live cells revealed identical photobleaching kinetics of mScarlet3-H and mScarlet-H.
    The fluorescence intensity, fluorescence spectra and fluorescence lifetime of
    mScarlet3-H were found to be strongly pH-dependent between pH 4-8. The fluorescence
    lifetime increased from 1 ns to 3 ns in lowering the pH from 8 to 4 with a pK
    of ~6. The much lower lifetime of mScarlet3-H (~1 ns) as compared to mScarlet3
    (~4 ns) allows dual fluorescence lifetime unmixing applications in single channel
    FLIM recordings in compartments with neutral to slightly alkaline pH. Furthermore,
    the strongly pH-dependent fluorescence lifetime of mScarlet3-H enables fluorescence
    lifetime-based pH sensing in a pH region between pH 5 to 7. Using this property,
    a pH of 6.5 was measured in the lumen of the Golgi system in living cells and
    motile endomembrane vesicles revealed pH values between 5.5 and 6. Also autophagy
    of the cytoplasm can be visualized by the pH-dependent fluorescence lifetime with
    mScarlet3-H accumulation in lysosomes. Potential useful applications and pitfalls
    regarding the special properties of mScarlet3-H are discussed.

  description: Attention can be guided by either voluntary (top-down) or involuntary
    (bottom-up) influences. In real-world vision, voluntary attention can be directed
    by a wide range of influences such as reward, priming, meaning, experience, selection
    history, and volition. Laboratory studies of voluntary attention have commonly
    used attention-directing cues to induce or instruct human subjects to attend one
    class of stimuli while ignoring others. In recent years, free choice conditions
    of attention have been introduced, where self-generated volitional shifts of attention
    (willed attention) are possible (for a review, see Nadra & Mangun, 2023). Prior
    willed attention studies have focused on mechanisms of covert spatial attention,
    investigating the neurophysiological correlates of willed attention related to
    both post-decision processing, and the pre-decision brain activity patterns that
    predict participants' free choices about where to attend. Much less work, however,
    has been done on willed non-spatial attention. In this study, in a fashion similar
    to prior willed spatial attention studies, we investigated willed attention to
    stimulus color. In a trial-by-trial cueing design, subjects were either cued what
    color to attend or were allowed to freely choose what color to attend, in order
    to subsequently discriminate visual features of the cued or willfully chosen target.
    Behavioral measures showed that the subjects were selectively attending the cued
    or willed color. Using support vector machine decoding on EEG alpha (8-12 Hz)
    signals, we found significant post-decision differences in alpha-band power and
    broadband EEG voltage when participants chose to attend to orange versus purple.
    However, in contrast to the findings in prior work on willed spatial attention,
    no pre-decision EEG signals could be identified that predicted which color participants
    would choose to attend to.

  description: The loss of pigmentation is a hallmark adaptation of cave-dwelling
    animals but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study investigates
    the cellular and biochemical basis of albinism, the loss of melanin pigment, which
    convergently evolved across a wide range of cave animals. Is albinism caused by
    the interruption of pigment synthesis or elimination of the pigment cell lineage?
    The results suggest that albinism evolved by a common mechanism, a block in the
    first step of the melanin biosynthesis pathway, the conversion of L-tyrosine to
    L-DOPA, in diverse albino cave animals ranging from annelids and mollusks to vertebrates.
    Pigment cells are conserved in all tested albino cave species and distributed
    in patterns resembling pigmentation in their close surface relatives. The cells
    capable of melanin synthesis when provided with L-DOPA substrate were detected
    at the sites of injuries in a cave annelid, cave mollusk, and cave teleost, suggesting
    roles in innate immunity during tissue repair, which may explain why pigment cells
    are conserved despite the loss of pigment production. Next, we focused on the
    longstanding issue of the evolutionary forces involved in the regression of pigmentation
    in cave animals and explored hypotheses of why losing pigmentation might be adaptive
    in cave environments. First, we tested the hypothesis that pigment regression
    may conserve energy, which is important for survival in the food-limited cave
    environment. Our results indicate that melanin synthesis has a marked energetic
    cost in the cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus. Lastly, we show that the disruption
    of melanin synthesis at its first biosynthetic step is correlated with increased
    dopamine levels in multiple depigmented cavefish populations, including populations
    that evolved albinism independently. This result supports a widespread tradeoff
    between the melanin and catecholamine synthesis pathways in A. mexicanus. We conclude
    that the interruption of the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA in the synthesis
    of melanin confers multiple advantages that could serve as targets of natural
    selection, supporting an adaptive hypothesis for the evolution of albinism in
    cave animals.

  description: Animal communication can be complex, often involving multiple static
    and dynamic traits. The extent to which these traits are correlated can elucidate
    their function as either redundant or multiple messages. Using the agamid lizard,
    Psammophilus dorsalis, as a model system we examined patterns of trait expression
    and the role of steroid hormones in mediating these traits during social interactions.
    We staged male-male interactions in the lab and measured the repertoire of display
    behaviour and colours, which change dynamically in the visible and ultraviolet
    ranges in different body regions. Additionally, we measured testosterone and corticosterone
    levels before and after the social trials. Our results show that within behaviour
    and colour trait categories, components were strongly correlated within individuals,
    suggesting either a shared physiological pathway or redundant information content.
    However, across trait categories, correlation patterns varied. The chromatic contrast
    of the (yellow) dorsal region of lizards was correlated with both body size and
    level of aggression, whereas the size of UV patches was correlated with body size
    only. We also found a negative association between baseline corticosterone levels,
    body size and dorsal yellow chromatic contrast, suggesting a mechanistic link
    between these traits. However, social interaction induced testosterone and corticosterone
    levels were uncorrelated with the expression of the dynamic behavioural and colour
    displays during the social interactions itself. Notably, the intensity of colour
    and behavioural displays of males were matched by their opponents. Overall, our
    results suggest that multiple signalling traits can ensure both redundancy as
    well as provide multiple messages to receivers, thus improving the robustness
    of information transfer, particularly during competitions which have high fitness
    consequences.

  description: Animal colouration is fundamentally important for social communication
    within conspecifics to advertising threat to competitors or fitness to possible
    mates. Social status and animal colouration are covarying traits that are plastic
    in response to dynamic environments. In the African cichlid, Astatotilapia burtoni,
    body colouration and behaviour have been extensively reported to vary with social
    rank. However, the nature of the interaction between these two traits is poorly
    understood. We hypothesise that pigmentation patterns could be linked to the behavioural
    repertoires underlying social status and can be resolved to regions on the cichlid
    body plan. To test this hypothesis, we generated Territorial (T) and Non-territorial
    (NT) males and employed computer vision tools to quantify and visualise patterns/colour
    enrichment associated with stereotyped T/NT male behaviour. We report colour-behaviour
    interactions localised in specific areas of the body and face for two colour morphs,
    illustrating a more nuanced view of social behaviour and pigmentation. Since behavioural
    and morphological variation are key drivers of selection in the East African Great
    Rift Lakes, we surmise our data may be translatable to other cichlid lineages
    and underline the importance of trait covariance in sexual selection and male
    competition.

  description: Damselfishes (Pomacentridae) are widespread and highly abundant on
    tropical coral reefs. They exhibit diverse body colouration within and between
    the ~250 species and across ontogenetic stages. In addition to human visible colours
    (i.e., 400-700 nm), most adult damselfishes reflect ultraviolet (UV, 300-400 nm)
    colour patches. UV sensitivity and UV colour signals are essential for feeding
    and form the basis for a secret communication channel invisible to the many UV-blind
    predatory fish on the reef; however, how these traits develop across ontogenetic
    stages, and their distribution across the damselfish family is poorly characterised.
    Here, we used UV photography, phylogenetic reconstructions of opsin genes, differential
    gene expression analysis (DGE) of retinal samples, to investigate the development
    of UV vision and colour patterns in three ontogenetic stages (pre-settlement larval,
    juvenile, and adult) of eleven damselfish species. Using DGE, we found similar
    gene expression between juveniles and adults, which strongly differed from larvae.
    All species and all stages expressed at least one UV-sensitive sws1 opsin gene.
    However, UV body colour patterns only started to appear at the juvenile stage.
    Moreover, Pomacentrus species displayed highly complex UV body patterns that were
    correlated with the expression of two sws1 copies. This could mean that some damselfishes
    can discriminate colours that change only in their UV component. We demonstrate
    dramatic shifts in both UV sensitivity and UV colouration across the development
    stages of damselfish, while highlighting the importance of considering ontogeny
    when studying the coevolution of visual systems and colour signals.

  description: The calcitonin (CT) family of related peptides exert their diverse
    physiological effects in mammals via two G-protein coupled receptors, CTR and
    the CTR-like receptor CLR. Analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of CT-type
    signaling has revealed the occurrence of CT-type peptides and CTR/CLR-type proteins
    in deuterostome and protostome invertebrates. Furthermore, experimental studies
    have revealed that in the protostome Drosophila melanogaster the CT-like peptide
    DH31 can act as a ligand for a CTR/CLR-type receptor and a pigment-dispersing
    factor (PDF) receptor. Here we investigated the signaling mechanisms and functions
    of CT-type neuropeptides in a deuterostome invertebrate, the sea cucumber Apostichopus
    japonicus (phylum Echinodermata). In A. japonicus, a single gene encodes two CT-type
    peptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2), both of which act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor
    (AjCTR) and two PDF-type receptors (AjPDFR1, AjPDFR2), but with differential activation
    of downstream cAMP/PKA, Gq/Ca2+/PKC and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Analysis of
    the expression of the gene encoding AjCT1 and AjCT2 revealed transcripts in a
    variety of organ systems, but with highest expression in the circumoral nervous
    system. In vitro pharmacological experiments revealed that AjCT1 and/or AjCT2
    cause dose-dependent relaxation of longitudinal body wall muscle and intestine
    preparations. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacological experiments and loss-of-function
    tests revealed a potential physiological role for AjCT2 signaling in promoting
    feeding and growth in A. japonicus. This is the first study to obtain evidence
    that CT-type peptides can act as ligands for both CTR/CLR-type and PDF-type receptors
    in a deuterostome. Furthermore, because of the economic importance of A. japonicus
    as a foodstuff, discovery of the potential role for CT-type peptides as regulators
    of feeding and growth in this species may provide a basis for practical applications
    in aquaculture.

  description: The relationships between facial expression and color affect human
    cognition functions such as perception and memory. However, whether these relationships
    influence attention remains unclear. Additionally, whether facial expressions
    affect selective attention is unknown; for example, reddish angry faces increase
    negative social evaluation or emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether selective
    attention is similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether
    event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color
    by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using
    stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original,
    red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target
    face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated
    that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended
    on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 amplitudes
    for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally,
    there was no significant main effect or interaction effect of facial expression
    or facial color on P1 amplitudes for the target, and there were significant main
    effects of facial expression only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest
    that the intensity of a human's selective attention to facial expressions varies
    according to the higher-order semantic processing of the relationship between
    emotion and color rather than simple facial expression or facial color effects
    individually. Our results support the idea that red color increases the human
    response to anger from an EEG perspective.

  description: Daily rhythms in mosquito attraction to humans are thought to drive
    biting patterns and contribute to disease transmission dynamics. Behavioral rhythms
    in many insects are controlled by specialized clock cells in the brain that are
    coordinated by the neuropeptide Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF). We show that
    female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with genetically disrupted PDF display altered
    daily behavioral timing with reduced locomotor activity and biting in the morning.
    Using an automated behavioral tracking system, we also report that mosquitoes
    exhibit daily modulation of response persistence to the host cue carbon dioxide
    and loss of PDF alters this pattern. These findings indicate that PDF regulates
    temporal features of host-seeking behavior that promote biting success at specific
    times of day and may underlie blood feeding patterns observed in the field.

  description: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is widely used as a technique for
    materials characterization. It has also been successfully applied to the imaging
    of biological samples, providing invaluable insights into the topography, morphology
    and composition of biological structures. A particular method combining different
    SEM detectors, named Density-Dependent Coloured SEM (DDC-SEM), has proven to be
    most useful for the identification and visualization of minerals in soft tissues.
    The method consists of a manipulation of original greyscale SEM images to produce
    coloured images that provide both topography and density information for samples
    with components of different densities. Here we provide a discussion on how to
    use DDC-SEM to aid the visualization and intuitive understanding of pathological
    calcification. This method has become popular not only for its scientific improvement
    of conventional SEM greyscale images, but also for its aesthetical merits.

  description: The pantropical family Annonaceae possesses a broad array of floral
    phenotypes and pollination specialisations. Being the most species-rich lineage
    in the magnoliids, Annonaceae are a major flowering plant component of tropical
    rainforests, and are important in the plant-pollinator network of this biome.
    Insects such as beetles, flies, bees, cockroaches and thrips have been reported
    as their pollinators. Although there has been considerable effort to assess their
    interactions with pollinators, attempts to characterise the visual and olfactory
    communication channels between them are scarce. Here, we report the floral phenology
    and characterise the spectral reflectance and odour of 12 Annonaceae species from
    five genera, viz. Meiogyne, Monoon, Polyalthia, Pseuduvaria, and Uvaria. Pseuduvaria
    species are either monoecious or dioecious while the four genera produce hermaphroditic
    flowers. The Meiogyne species are likely pollinated by small beetles; the Polyalthia
    and Pseuduvaria species are likely pollinated by both beetles and flies; and the
    Uvaria species is likely pollinated by both beetles and bees. All species produce
    flowers that are not reflective in the 300-350 nm UV spectrum, and have various
    spectral reflectance profile across the remaining UV and visible spectra. We detected
    diverse floral volatiles across all the species assessed. The flowers of the small
    beetle-pollinated species, including Meiogyne species and Polyalthia xanthocarpa,
    emitted mostly branched-chain esters, including isobutyl acetate and isoamyl acetate.
    The Pseuduvaria species emitted scent reminiscent of rotten fruit, largely consisting
    of 2,3-butanediol, a common by-product in yeast fermentation. The flowers of Uvaria
    concava, which were visited by both bees and beetles, released mainly straight-chain
    esters, including methyl hexanoate and methyl (Z)-4-octenoate. A corrugated inner
    petal outgrowth was observed in Meiogyne and Pseuduvaria; this functions as a
    food body reward in Meiogyne, but as a nectary gland for Pseuduvaria. This study
    provides insights into how Annonaceae flowers attract different guilds of pollinators.

  description: Polymorphism, the presence of discrete floral morphs within a population,
    can be maintained by positive or negative frequency selection. Pollinators often
    show a positive frequency-dependent foraging which confers reproductive advantage
    to common morphs over rare morphs. However, pollinator-mediated selections often
    act on visual floral displays. Here, we investigate hawkmoth-mediated selection
    in a nocturnal Curcuma caulina (Zingiberaceae) with bract colour polymorphism,
    where the role of visual display is minimal. We used path analyses to explain
    maintenance of differential morph abundances in C. caulina. For this, we quantified
    inter-morph trait variations in floral structures, nectar traits, pollinator visitations,
    physiological compatibilities and reproductive fitness. We noted that the rarest
    morph was self-compatible, exhibited higher nectar reward and pollinator visits,
    and low reproductive fitness, whereas the two common morphs were complete to partially
    self-incompatible, with lower nectar rewards and pollinator visits, but higher
    reproductive fitness. We conclude that while hawkmoths show a positive response
    to floral rewards, self-compatibility confers lower reproductive fitness to the
    nectar-rich rare morphs. In contrast, self-incompatibility confers higher fitness
    to the common morphs despite lower pollinator visits. Thus, colour polymorphism
    in nocturnal C. caulina is explained by floral traits associated with bract colour,
    which are under pollinator-mediated selection.

  description: 'Carbon flux to the deep sea can be dictated by surface ocean phytoplankton
    community composition, but translating surface ocean observations into quantitative
    predictions of carbon export requires additional consideration of the underlying
    ecosystem drivers. Here, we used genetic tracers of phytoplankton detected in
    surface seawater and within sinking particles collected in the mesopelagic ocean
    to identify mechanistic links between surface communities and carbon export in
    the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Phytoplankton 18S rRNA sequences
    were sampled over a one-month period in surface seawater and within bulk-collected
    and individually-isolated sinking particles using mesopelagic sediment traps (100-500m).
    Nearly all phytoplankton amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) exported from the surface
    were packaged in large (>300 m) particles. Individually, these particles contained
    only a few distinct phytoplankton ASVs, but collectively, large particles transported
    about half of the surface taxonomic diversity into the mesopelagic. The relative
    sequence abundances of the surface community detected within particles were quantitatively
    related to measured POC fluxes: a linear model based on the relative sequence
    abundance of just two pigment-based phytoplankton taxa, diatoms and photosynthetic
    Hacrobia, was predictive of POC flux magnitude. These two taxa were also enriched
    within the ecologically-distinct particle classes that had the greatest influence
    on carbon export magnitude. As global, hyperspectral ocean color satellites begin
    to quantify these taxonomic groups in the surface ocean, the relationship of these
    taxa to carbon fluxes demonstrated here may help generate more accurate global
    estimates of export.'

  description: Fireflies use bioluminescent signals to communicate with their mates.
    Luciferase has been thought to be the sole contributor to light color; however,
    populations of the Photinus pyralis firefly display variation in the color of
    their emitted signals yet have identical luciferase sequences. Here, we examined
    whether pigments could be present in the light organs of the twilight-active species
    P. pyralis and contribute to this variation. We detected patterns of expression
    that suggest ommochrome and pterin screening pigments are expressed in P. pyralis
    light organs and could filter light emitted by luciferase and play a role in signal
    tuning. There were no significant differences between the pigment gene expression
    of P. pyralis individuals with yellower and greener signals. Our study provides
    alternative mechanisms that could influence pigments in P. pyralis light organs
    that could also play a role in modifying signal color.

  description: The radiation of angiosperms is marked by a phenomenal diversity of
    floral size, shape, color, scent, and reward. Through hundreds of years of documentation
    and quantification scientists have sought to make sense of this variation by defining
    pollination syndromes as the convergent evolution of common suits of floral traits
    across distantly related species that have evolved by selection to optimize pollination
    strategies. Now, with the rise in popularity of community science platforms like
    iNaturalist, anyone - not just scientists - can collect data. Thanks to the availability
    of high-quality community-science datasets, we have an unprecedented number of
    observations of natural flowering plant diversity. These datasets provide an opportunity
    to develop new tools and to examine new traits, such as flowering time, that may
    help further characterize pollination syndromes. Here we test the hypothesis that
    flowering phenology can also be an important trait of a pollination syndrome;
    particularly of the "hummingbird flower" syndrome, which is usually characterized
    by red color, long corolla tubes, and exserted stamens. We produced a novel flower
    color dataset by using GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V) to assign flower color to 11,729
    North American flowering plant species from community science photographs. We
    then mapped those species-specific colors to 1,674,908 citizen scientist observations
    of flowering plants. We demonstrate constrained flowering time in the eastern
    U.S. for species with red or orange flowers relative to species with flowers of
    other colors. Importantly, the onset of flowering corresponds closely to the arrival
    of hummingbirds. Our findings reveal an opportunity to expand the suite of traits
    included in pollination syndrome and suggest that the hummingbird pollination
    syndrome can include flowering phenology. Our methods demonstrate an effective
    pipeline for leveraging the enormous amount of community science data by extracting
    valuable information about patterns of trait variation.

  description: Color vision assessment is essential in clinical practice, yet different
    tests exhibit distinct strengths and limitations. Here we apply a psychophysical
    paradigm, Angular Indication Measurement (AIM) for color detection and discrimination.
    AIM is designed to address some of the shortcomings of existing tests, such as
    prolonged testing time, limited accuracy and sensitivity, and the necessity for
    clinician oversight. AIM presents adaptively generated charts, each a N*M (here
    4*4) grid of stimuli, and participants are instructed to indicate either the orientation
    of the gap in a cone-isolating Landolt C optotype or the orientation of the edge
    between two colors in an equiluminant color space. The contrasts or color differences
    of the stimuli are adaptively selected for each chart based on performance of
    prior AIM charts. In a group of 23 color-normal and 15 people with color vision
    deficiency (CVD), we validate AIM color against Hardy-Rand-Rittler (HRR), Farnsworth-Munsell
    100 hue test (FM100), and anomaloscope color matching diagnosis and use machine
    learning techniques to classify the type and severity of CVD. The results show
    that AIM has classification accuracies comparable to that of the anomaloscope,
    and while HRR and FM100 are less accurate than AIM and an anomaloscope, HRR is
    very rapid. We conclude that AIM is a computer-based, self-administered, response-adaptive
    and rapid tool with high test-retest repeatability that has the potential to be
    suitable for both clinical and research applications.

  description: The mining of genomes across life has unearthed a bounty of biosynthetic
    potential to diverse molecules key to a biobased future. While the heterologous
    expression of metabolic pathways has achieved broad success, most approaches suffer
    a similar fate in low initial production levels that require extensive, resource-heavy
    iterative strain engineering refinement. Herein we introduce a growth-coupled
    biosynthetic (GrowBio) strategy that irrevocably connects microbial growth with
    specialized compound production. We demonstrate the plug-and-play versatility
    of GrowBio in the production of the structurally complex animal biopigment xanthommatin,
    a color-changing ommochrome with material and cosmetic potential. Xanthommatin
    biosynthesis directly fuels growth of a newly designed Pseudomonas putida 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
    auxotroph (PUMA). Aided by genome-scale metabolic modeling, PUMA was designed
    and built to be controlled by endogenous formate co-produced as a coupled biosynthetic
    byproduct in the multistep conversion of tryptophan to xanthommatin. Adaptive
    laboratory evolution was utilized to streamline xanthommatin's gram-scale bioproduction
    via growth rate selection, establishing GrowBio as a promising biotechnological
    approach for establishing and optimizing the microbial production of value-added
    molecules.

  description: Lignin is a crucial component of the cell wall, providing mechanical
    support and protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. However, little is
    known about wheat lignin-related mutants and their roles in pathogen defense.
    In this study, we identified an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-derived Aegilops
    tauschii mutant named brown glume and internode 1 (bgi1), which exhibits reddish-brown
    pigmentation in various tissues, including internodes, spikes, and glumes. Using
    map-based cloning and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, we identified
    AET6Gv20438400 (BGI1) as the leading candidate gene, encoding the TaCAD1 protein.
    The mutation occurred in the splice acceptor site of the first intron, resulting
    in a premature stop codon in BGI1. We validated the function of BGI1 using loss-of-function
    EMS and gene editing knockout mutants, both of which displayed reddish-brown pigmentation
    in lignified tissues. BGI1 knockout mutants exhibited reduced lignin content and
    shearing force relative to wild type, while BGI1 overexpression transgenic plants
    showed increased lignin content and enhanced disease resistance against common
    root rot and Fusarium crown rot. We confirmed that BGI1 exhibits CAD activity
    both in vitro and in vivo, playing an important role in lignin biosynthesis. BGI1
    was highly expressed in the stem and spike and localized in the cytoplasm. Transcriptome
    analysis revealed the regulatory networks associated with BGI1. Finally, we demonstrated
    that BGI1 interacts with TaPYL-1D, potentially involved in the abscisic acid signaling
    pathway. The identification and functional characterization of BGI1 significantly
    advance our understanding of CAD proteins in lignin biosynthesis and plant defense
    against pathogen infection in wheat.

  description: There is high demand for microbial pigments as promising alternative
    for synthetic pigments basically for safety and economic reasons. This study aimed
    at the optimization of yellowish-orange pigment production by Exiguobacterium
    aurantiacum using agro-waste extract as growth substrate. Air samples were collected
    using depositional method. Pure cultures of pigment producing bacteria were isolated
    by subsequent culturing on fresh nutrient agar medium and the potent isolate was
    identified using MALDI-TOF technique. Culture conditions were screened using Plackett-Burman
    design and the most three significant variables were optimized by response surface
    methodology. Fermentation was conducted in 150 mL agro-waste decoctions from which
    tomato waste extract was selected because of higher optical density of the culture
    compared to other agro-waste extracts. Pigment was extracted by solvent extraction
    method and the best solvent was selected based on its ability to dissolve the
    culture suspension. The pigment was characterized using spectroscopic and chromatographic
    techniques. Culture agitation rate, initial medium pH and concentration of yeast
    extract were identified as the most significant (p< 0.0001) variables affecting
    pigment production. At optimized conditions, 0.96 g/L of pigment was extracted
    from 4.73 g/L of culture biomass and the extracted pigment under optimized conditions
    was 1.6 times higher than the pigment extracted under un-optimized conditions.
    The spectroscopic and chromatographic analyses demonstrated the presence of different
    functional groups and carotenoids were identified as parts of the molecule responsible
    for the yellowish-orange pigmentation of the extract. This study demonstrated
    the potential for optimization of pigment production by bacteria using agro-waste
    extract as substrate. Hence, the current findings strongly encourage for further
    study at a large-scale level for industrial production.

  description: The face is a uniquely distinctive stimulus for humans, encapsulating
    a wealth of information. Among the myriad of social cues conveyed by the face,
    emotional signals, known as facial expressions, are paramount not only for humans
    but also for numerous social animals. The evolution of facial expressions in these
    animals can also manifest in taxa other than mammals, as suggested by various
    studies highlighting the socio-ecological benefits of facial expressions. In this
    study, we elucidated the social function of facial coloration, determined by melanophores,
    in the neotropical social cichlid Symphysodon aequifasciatus. In this species,
    facial coloration exhibits flexibility and instantaneous changes in response to
    varying social contexts. Through behavioral observations and experimental manipulation,
    we confirmed that facial coloration in S. aequifasciatus serves to attenuate unnecessary
    aggressive competition among conspecifics. Furthermore, we observed that the facial
    area subjected to coloration in this species is innervated by the adenosine triphosphate-
    and noradrenaline-ergic nervous system. These findings indicated that facial expression
    in S. aequifasciatus depends on the sympathetic nervous system and has evolved
    independently of mammalian facial expressions. Our study highlights teleost fishes
    as valuable animal models for exploring the universality of facial expressions
    and their underlying cognitive mechanisms in vertebrates.

    within genetically discrete morphs affects selective dynamics, which narrows our
    understanding of how color polymorphisms persist. Our comprehensive analysis of
    43 years of plumage color scores from a bi-morphic Finnish population of tawny
    owls (Strix aluco) reveals that intra-morph variation is substantial, but also
    unexpectedly dynamic. We show that both morphs recently diverged in their plumage
    coloration: while the brown morph is on a steady trajectory toward more intense
    plumage pigmentation, the gray morph has recently shifted toward lighter plumage,
    following a series of extreme winters. Evidence suggests that this divergence
    is driven by the brown morph''s higher reproductive success and greater plasticity
    in response to seasonality, while the gray morph, with its more genetically determined
    plumage color and limited standing variation, has a reduced capacity to respond
    to selection and track new phenotypic optima. Our study confirms the presence
    of substantial and dynamic phenotypic variation within genetically discrete color
    morphs, and demonstrates its relevance for the evolutionary potential of populations
    to respond to environmental change.'

  description: We quantified the relative effect of plasticity and heritability on
    Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) leaf reflectance using clonal replicates
    propagated from 16 populations and grown across three common gardens spanning
    a mean annual temperature gradient of 10.7-22.3{degrees}C. We used variance partitioning
    to decompose phenotypic variation expressed in the leaf spectra into genotypic
    versus environmental components and estimate broad-sense heritability and found
    that heritability was most strongly expressed in the red-edge (~680-750nm) and
    SWIR (~1400-3000nm). Support vector machine models predicted P. fremontii source
    population and garden location at 78% and 93% accuracy, respectively, demonstrating
    that genotypic and environmental variation can be differentiated from the same
    leaf spectra. However, model accuracy declined by ~49% when using leaf reflectance
    from any two common gardens to predict the source population at the third site.
    Prediction accuracies were lowest for the hottest site, which was linked to leaf
    stress responses in the visible and red-edge wavelengths (400-750nm). We conclude
    that leaf spectra display heritability and plasticity across different parts of
    the spectrum. When mapping in regions/seasons with extreme climates, spectral
    plasticity linked to heat stress can decrease spectral heritability but may offer
    opportunities to understand phenological responses to extreme temperatures at
    large scales.

  description: A combination of sectioning and microscopy techniques, along with the
    application of finite-difference-time-domain modeling on a fossil feather, novelly
    results in the estimation of the range of iridescent colors from fossilized melanosomes
    preserved in the elongate head crest feathers of a new Cretaceous enantiornithine
    bird. The densely packed rod-like melanosomes yield are estimated to have yielded
    from red to deep blue iridescent coloration of the head feathers. The shape and
    density of these melanosome may have also further increased the feathers structural
    strength. This occurrence on a likely male individual is highly suggestive of
    both a signaling function of the iridescent crest, and a potential behavioral
    role in adjusting the angle of light incidence to control the display of this
    iridescent structural coloration.

  description: The extensive increase in non-biodegradable plastic waste is leading
    to heightened pollution and severe impacts on the climate. The marine environment
    withstands the worst of plastic pollution, with a documented accumulation of 86
    million tons of plastic debris globally. Humans are directly impacted by degraded
    plastic waste through direct consumption (e.g., in tap water), indirect consumption
    (via the consumption of contaminated animals), and interference with various hormonal
    mechanisms. In the 20th century, human-produced plastics constituted approximately
    3% of the world's total biomass. In addressing this issue, we embarked on the
    development of plastic bricks, emphasizing the repurposing of plastic waste. To
    distinguish our approach, we incorporated a luminescent quality using the inherent
    fluorescent property of the pyoverdine pigment produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
    This luminescence aims to mitigate nocturnal visibility issues, which contribute
    to accidents involving both human and speechless fauna.

  description: In recent years, the automation of genotyping has significantly enhanced
    the efficiency of genome-wide association studies. Due to this development, phenotyping
    is now usually the rate-limiting step, especially in the field. Efforts are now
    focused on further automating in-field phenotyping. Here we present a GWAS study
    on 194 field-grown accessions of lettuce (Lactuca sativa). These accessions were
    non-destructively phenotyped at two time points 15 days apart using an unmanned
    aerial vehicle. Our high throughput phenotyping approach integrates an RGB camera,
    a multispectral camera to measure the reflectance at 5 wavelengths (blue, green,
    red, red edge, near-infrared), and precise height estimation. We used the mean
    and other descriptives such as median, quantiles, minimum and maximum to quantify
    different aspects of color and height variation in lettuce from the drone images.
    Using this approach, we confirm several previously described QTLs, now in populations
    grown under field conditions and identify several new QTLs for plant-height and
    color.

  description: Color polymorphism can influence the evolutionary fate of cryptic species
    because it increases populations' chances of survival in heterogenous or variable
    environments. Yet, little is known about the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms
    underlying the persistence of cryptic color polymorphisms, or the impact these
    polymorphisms have on the macro-evolutionary dynamics of lineages. Here, we examine
    the evolutionary history of the most widespread cryptic color polymorphism in
    anurans, involving green and brown morphs. Using an order-scale comparative analysis,
    we show that these morphs can co-exist within species over long periods of evolutionary
    time and that polymorphic lineages switch habitat more frequently and have greater
    diversification rates than other groups. We then identify the locus responsible
    for the green/brown polymorphism in a group of African grass frogs, and demonstrate
    that this genomic region is evolving under long-term balancing selection, resulting
    in trans-specific polymorphism. These results provide a micro-evolutionary mechanism
    for the long-term persistence of color polymorphism observed at a macro-evolutionary
    scale. This study highlights the importance of cryptic color polymorphism in the
    ecology and evolution of anurans, and provides a framework for future research
    on the genetic architecture and selective forces underlying cryptic traits.

  description: The X-linked orange (O) locus in domestic cats controls an unknown
    molecular mechanism that causes the suppression of black-brownish pigmentation
    in favor of orange coloration. The alternating black-brownish and orange patches
    seen in tortoiseshell and calico cats are considered as classic examples of the
    phenotypic expression of random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) occurring in female
    mammals. However, the O gene in the cat genome has not been identified, and the
    genetic variation responsible for the orange coloration remains unknown. We report
    here that a 5.1-kilobase (kb) deletion within an intron of the X-linked ARHGAP36
    gene, encoding a Rho GTPase activating protein, is closely and exclusively associated
    with orange coloration. The deleted region contains a highly conserved putative
    regulatory element, whose removal presumably cause altered ARHGAP36 expression.
    Notably, ARHGAP36 expression in cat skin tissues is linked to the suppression
    of many melanogenesis genes, potentially shifting pigment synthesis from eumelanin
    to pheomelanin. Furthermore, we find evidence that the gene undergoes XCI in female
    human and mouse cells, and XCI-dependent CpG island methylation consistent with
    random XCI in female domestic cats. The 5.1-kb deletion seems widespread in domestic
    cats with orange coat coloration, suggesting a single origin of this coat color
    phenotype.

  description: The Sex-linked orange mutation in domestic cats causes variegated patches
    of reddish/yellow hair and is a defining signature of random X-inactivation in
    female tortoiseshell and calico cats. Unlike the situation for most coat color
    genes, there is no apparent homolog for Sex-linked orange in other mammals. We
    show that the Sex-linked orange is caused by a 5 kb deletion that leads to ectopic
    and melanocyte-specific expression of the Rho GTPase Activating Protein 36 (Arhgap36)
    gene. Single cell RNA-seq studies from fetal cat skin reveal that red/yellow hair
    color is caused by reduced expression of melanogenic genes that are normally activated
    by the Melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r)-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein
    kinase A (PKA) pathway, but the Mc1r gene and its ability to stimulate cAMP accumulation
    is intact. Instead, we show that increased expression of Arhgap36 in melanocytes
    leads to reduced levels of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAC); thus, Sex-linked
    orange is genetically and biochemically downstream of Mc1r. Our findings solve
    a comparative genomic conundrum, provide in vivo evidence for the ability of Arhgap36
    to inhibit PKA, and reveal a molecular explanation for a charismatic color pattern
    with a rich genetic history.

  description: Bacillus subtilis is widely studied in the microbial secondary metabolite
    (SM) field due to its rich variety of important natural products and genetic tractability.
    However, identification of novel SMs and their biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs),
    has become increasingly difficult, especially in Bacilli, as the tools for screening
    and genome mining are dependent on clear function or similarity to already known
    BGCs. Pigments are SMs identified by their absorption of visible light, resulting
    in a certain color perceived by our eyes at sufficient concentrations. Thereby,
    pigments provide the evidence of a BGC without knowing the sequence or function.
    Expanding the known repertoire of SM BGCs with novel BGCs will further reinforce
    identification of a broader set of BGCs by mining tools such as antiSMASH. Here,
    we study a pigment observed in B. subtilis soil isolate MB9_B4 on certain media.
    We characterize the conditions where this pigment is produced and identify the
    corresponding BGC using a comparative genomic approach exploiting our strain collection
    containing other isolates with pigment production ability. The responsible BGC
    carried several genes, which were annotated as parts of the tryptophan biosynthesis
    pathway, possibly originating from a duplication and divergence of an originally
    primary metabolism. Identification of the pigment gene cluster additionally lead
    to the discovery of additional pigment BGC carrier B. subtilis isolates, some
    of which were described at the earliest in 1896 under the name Bacillus aterrimus,
    with a name referring to a dark pigmentation (the Latin aterrimus meaning very
    black). In addition, we employed solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier
    transform infrared spectroscopies to characterize the chemical groups of the pigment.
    This study describes the chemical and biological features of a new class of SM
    BGC, which we hope will serve to improve the current BGC discovery pipelines in
    Bacilli.

  description: The carotenoid-based colors of birds are a celebrated example of biological
    diversity and an important system for the study of evolution. Recently, a two-step
    mechanism, with the enzymes cytochrome P450 2J19 (CYP2J19) and 3-hydroxybutyrate
    dehydrogenase 1-like (BDH1L), was described for the biosynthesis of red ketocarotenoids
    from yellow dietary carotenoids in the retina and plumage of birds. A common assumption
    has been that all birds with ketocarotenoid-based plumage coloration used this
    CYP2J19/BDH1L mechanism to produce red feathers. We tested this assumption in
    house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) by examining the catalytic function of the
    house finch homologs of these enzymes and tracking their expression in molting
    birds. We found that CYP2J19 and BDH1L did not catalyze the production of 3-hydroxy-echinenone
    (3-OH-echinenone), the primary red plumage pigment of house finches, when provided
    with common dietary carotenoid substrates. Moreover, gene expression analyses
    revealed little to no expression of CYP2J19 in liver tissue or growing feather
    follicles, the putative sites of pigment metabolism in molting house finches.
    Finally, although the hepatic mitochondria of house finches have high concentrations
    of 3-OH-echinenone, observations using fluorescent markers suggest that both CYP2J19
    and BDH1L localize to the endomembrane system rather than the mitochondria. We
    propose that house finches and other birds that deposit 3-OH-echinenone as their
    primary red plumage pigment use an alternative enzymatic pathway to produce their
    characteristic red ketocarotenoid-based coloration.

  description: The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a specialised monolayer of
    pigmented epithelial cells in the outer retina. The embryology and biology of
    pigmentation in the RPE differs from other pigmented tissues such as the hair,
    skin and iris. The extent to which RPE pigmentation is related to that of other
    tissues remains unclear, and this study aims to address this knowledge gap. Here,
    we utilised RPE thickness measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging
    as a surrogate phenotype for RPE melanin content. We used UK Biobank data to assess
    the phenotypic relationships between RPE thickness and fundus pigmentation (principally
    a measure of choroidal pigmentation), hair colour, skin colour, and ability to
    tan. We subsequently performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify
    genetic loci associated with RPE thickness. We utilised the obtained genetic data
    to explore the global and local genetic correlation between RPE thickness and
    other pigmentation-related traits. We found that RPE thickness is not phenotypically
    or globally genetically correlated with hair colour, skin colour or ability to
    tan. Whilst RPE thickness was phenotypically correlated with retinal pigmentation
    score, there was not significant global genetic correlation. Despite this, variants
    in key pigmentation loci including TYR, and OCA2-HERC2 were found to be significant
    in our GWAS of RPE thickness. Furthermore, we identified four genetic regions
    in which RPE thickness is locally genetically correlated with other pigmentation-related
    traits, all of which contain protein-coding genes that are central to melanogenesis
    and melanosome transport. In conclusion, our study supports our assertion that
    pigmentation plays a role in RPE thickness, and highlights both shared and divergent
    features of RPE and other pigmentation-related traits.

  description: 'To provide a stable percept of the surface color of objects, the visual
    system needs to account for variation in illumination chromaticity. This ability
    is called color constancy. The details of how the visual system disambiguates
    effects of illumination and reflectance on the light reaching the eye are still
    unclear. Here we asked how independent illumination and reflectance judgments
    are of each other, whether color constancy depends on explicitly identifying the
    illumination chromaticity, and what kinds of contextual cues support this identification.
    We studied the simultaneous identification of illumination and reflectance changes
    with realistically rendered, abstract 3D-scenes. Observers were tasked to identify
    both of these changes between sequentially presented stimuli. The stimuli included
    a central object whose reflectance could vary, and a background that only varied
    due to changes in illumination chromaticity. We manipulated the visual cues available
    in the background: local contrast and specular highlights. Identification of illumination
    and reflectance changes was not independent: While reflectance changes were rarely
    mis-identified as illumination changes, illumination changes clearly biased reflectance
    judgments. However, correct identification of reflectance changes was also not
    fully dependent on correctly identifying the illumination change: Only when there
    was no illumination change in the stimulus did it lead to better color constancy,
    that is, correctly identifying the reflectance change. Discriminability of illumination
    changes did not vary based on available visual cues, but discriminability of reflectance
    changes was improved with local contrast, and to a lesser extent with specular
    highlights, in the stimulus. We conclude that a failure of color constancy does
    not depend on a failure to identify illumination changes, but additional visual
    cues still improve color constancy through better disambiguation of illumination
    and reflectance changes.'

  description: 'Background: Digital color indices provide a reliable means for assessing
    plant health status by enabling real-time estimation of chlorophyll (Chl) content,
    and are thus adopted widely for crop monitoring. However, as all prevalent leaf
    color indices used for this purpose have been developed using green-leaved plants,
    they do not perform reliably for anthocyanin (Anth)-rich red-leaved varieties.
    Hence, the present study investigates digital color indices for six types of leafy
    vegetables with different levels of Anth to identify congruent trends that could
    be implemented universally for non-invasive crop monitoring irrespective of species
    and leaf Anth content. For this, datasets from three digital color spaces, viz.,
    RGB (Red, Green, Blue), HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value), and L*a*b* (Lightness, Redness-greenness,
    Yellowness-blueness), as well as various derived plant color indices were compared
    with SPAD Chl meter readings and Anth/Chl ratio of n = 320 leaf samples. Results:
    While most digital color features and indices presented abrupt shifts between
    Anth-rich and green-leaved samples, the newly-developed color index Two-fold Red
    Excess (TREx) as well as the color feature R showed very strong correlation with
    SPAD readings (R2 > 0.84), and did not exhibit any deviation due to leaf Anth
    content. Moreover, both parameters could predict SPAD values reliably (R2 > 0.75).
    Further, logarithmic decline of G/R and Augmented Green-Red Index (AGRI) with
    increasing Anth/Chl ratio (R2 > 0.82) revealed that relative Anth content affected
    digital color indices markedly by shifting the R:G balance until the Anth/Chl
    ratio reached a certain threshold. Conclusion: The present study provides the
    first in-depth assessment of variations in RGB-based digital color indices due
    to high leaf Anth contents, and uses the data for Anth-rich as well as green-leaved
    crops belonging to different species to develop a universal digital color index
    TREx that can be used as a reliable alternative to handheld Chl meters for rapid
    high-throughput monitoring of green-leaved as well as red-leaved crop varieties.'

  description: Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is an economically important leafy vegetable
    crop around the world. Recently, transgenic lettuce has been developed to improve
    agronomic traits. Although plant regeneration is a key step in plant genetic transformation,
    it depends strongly on the cultivar. In this study, shoot regeneration efficiency
    was measured by using two leaf lettuce cultivars, Chima-sanchi, white seed cultivar,
    and Chirimen-chisya, brown seed cultivar, a basal salt mixture, and a combination
    of the cytokinin, 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), and an auxin, 1-naphthaleneacetic
    acid (NAA). Efficient shoot regeneration in Chima-sanchi was thus obtained on
    1 x Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) with 0.05 mg L-1 BAP and 0.1 mg L-1 NAA. However,
    the highest efficiency was obtained in Chirimen-chisya on 1 x MS with 0.5 mg L-1
    BAP and 0.1 mg L-1 NAA. Therefore, the BAP concentration for efficient shoot regeneration
    differs significantly between the two cultivars. These cultivars also have different
    seed coat colors. Due to the similar results obtained from analyzing 4 additional
    cultivars, 2 white seed cultivars and 2 brown seed cultivars, we demonstrated
    a strong correlation between the BAP concentration for efficient shoot regeneration
    and the seed coat color in leaf lettuce.

  description: PMEL amyloids provide a vital scaffold for melanin deposition in melanosomes,
    playing a central role in pigmentation. Despite their importance, the high-resolution
    structure of PMEL amyloids has remained elusive. Here, we determined near-atomic
    resolution structures of wild-type PMEL amyloids using cryo-electron microscopy,
    revealing two distinct polymorphic forms with unique structural features. We further
    examined the pathogenic G175S mutation linked to pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS).
    Structural analysis showed that the G175S mutation introduces an additional hydrogen
    bond, stabilizing a novel fibril conformation. In vitro assays demonstrated a
    fourfold increase in polymerization efficiency for the G175S mutant compared to
    the wild-type. This enhanced polymerization correlated with a ~70% increase in
    secreted amyloids in G175S-expressing cells without detectable changes in melanosome
    morphology or number. These findings suggest that the G175S mutation promotes
    amyloidogenesis within melanosomes, increasing amyloid load and contributing to
    PDS pathophysiology. This study provides insights into the molecular basis of
    PMEL amyloid formation in both physiological and pathological contexts, offering
    new perspectives on their structural diversity and dysregulation in pigmentation
    disorders.

  description: Fluorogenic dyes that light up in complexes with genetically encodable
    RNA aptamers are increasingly used for intracellular RNA imaging. The growing
    toolbox of dyes and aptamers allows simultaneous or sequential monitoring of different
    RNAs. However, few orthogonal aptamer-dye pairs meet all the requirements of multiplex
    imaging in terms of brightness, contrast, etc., thus necessitating their optimization
    and further diversification. Here, we report new fluorogenic ligands for the Mango
    II aptamer, one of the most stable and widely used RNA tags. They are based on
    the cognate Mango ligand TO1-B, which is a thiazole orange (TO) derivative with
    a biotinylated tetraethylene glycol (TEG) residue attached via an amide linker,
    and its analogue with an isosteric triazolyl linker (TO1-triazolyl-TEG-biotin).
    Structural data suggested that the biotin residue might be dispensable for interactions
    with Mango, so we replaced it with a second TO residue or the alternative push-pull
    system, namely the dimethylaminophenyl (DMAP) group linked to the benzothiazolyl
    (BzT) group via the ethenyl linker. The resulting "double-headed" symmetric and
    asymmetric dyes showed reduced fluorescence in the free state due to intramolecular
    TO/TO or TO/DMAP-BzT interactions. The asymmetric dye exhibited intramolecular
    FRET in complex with Mango, resulting in a remarkably large (130 nm) Stocks shift,
    which may be advantageous for multiplex imaging. The main limitation of the "double-headed"
    dyes was their low brightness. To improve brightness, we further optimized the
    truncated (biotin-free) TO1-triazolyl-TEG dye by introducing a hydroxy or a methoxy
    group into the methylqunolinium (MQ) fragment of its push-pull system. The brightness
    of the methoxy-MQ derivative was increased by 40% compared to the reported TO1-triazolyl-TEG-biotin.
    Importantly, the methoxy-MQ derivative also showed increased selectivity for Mango
    over other noncanonical nucleic acids structures, making it a promising alternative
    to known TO-based dyes for high-contrast RNA imaging.

  description: 'Identifying the genes and mutations that drive phenotypic variation
    and which are subject to selection is crucial for understanding evolutionary processes.
    Mormon Fritillary butterflies (Speyeria mormonia) exhibit a striking wing color
    polymorphism throughout their range: typical morphs bear silver spots on their
    ventral surfaces, and can co-occur with unsilvered morphs displaying a dull coloration.
    Through genome-wide association studies in two polymorphic populations, we fine-map
    this difference in silvering to the 3'' region of the transcription factor gene
    optix. The expression of optix is confined to the unsilvered regions that surround
    the spots, and these patterns are transformed to a silver identity upon optix
    RNAi knockdown, implicating optix as a repressor of silver scales in this butterfly.
    We show that the unsilvered optix haplotype shows signatures of recent selective
    sweeps, and that this allele is shared with the monomorphic, unsilvered species
    Speyeria hydaspe, suggesting that introgressions facilitate the exchange of variants
    of adaptive potential across species. Remarkably, these findings parallel the
    role of introgressions and cis-regulatory modulation of optix in shaping the aposematic
    red patterns of Heliconius butterflies, a lineage that separated from Speyeria
    45 million years ago. The genetic basis of adaptive variation can thus be more
    predictable than often presumed, even for traits that appear divergent across
    large evolutionary distances.'

  description: Color perception is based on the differential spectral responses of
    the L, M and S-cones, subsequent subcortical and cortical computations, and may
    include the influence of higher order factors such as language. Although the early
    subcortical stages of color vision are well characterised, the organization of
    cortical representations of color remain elusive, despite numerous models based
    on discrimination thresholds, appearance and categorization. An underexplored
    aspect of cortical color representations is their dynamic evolution. Here we compare
    the evolution of three different color representations over time using magnetoencephalography
    (MEG). We measured neural responses to 14 hues at each of 3 achromatic offsets
    (increment, isoluminant and decrement) while participants attended either to the
    exact color of the stimulus or its color category. We used a series of classification
    analyses, combined with multidimensional scaling (MDS) and Representational Similarity
    Analysis, to ask how cortical representations of color unfold over time from stimulus
    onset. We compared the performance of 'higher order' models based on hue and color
    category with a model based simply on stimulus cone contrast and found that all
    models had significant correlations with the data. However, the unique variance
    accounted for by each model revealed a dynamic change in hue responses over time,
    that was consistent with a 'coarse to fine' transition from a broad clustering
    into categorical groups to a finer within category representation. Notably, these
    dynamics were replicated across datasets from both tasks, suggesting they reflect
    a robust reorganization of cortical hue responses over time.

  description: Coral bleaching, the breakdown of the symbiosis between the coral host
    and endosymbiotic microalgae, is the main cause of widespread coral reef degradation.
    Current methods for assessing coral health based on visual appearance, such as
    the use of color reference cards, are limited by subjective human color perception
    and low resolution. Digital photography with RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color channel
    analyses offers a fast, non-invasive, and standardized alternative to estimate
    physiological parameters. However, the link between coral color and physiological
    parameters during bleaching may vary depending on the type of stressor. While
    such approaches are extensively used in plant studies, their application in estimating
    Symbiodiniaceae cell density and chlorophyll content in corals requires further
    attention. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between Symbiodiniaceae
    cell density and chlorophyll content across three coral species (Acropora muricata,
    Pocillopora verrucosa, and Stylophora pistillata) with 19 color indices derived
    from the RGB channels currently established as predictors of chlorophyll content
    in plants. Corals were exposed to three bleaching conditions (acute short-term
    and chronic long-term heat stress and menthol bleaching) to identify the best
    color indices for assessing coral health through image analysis. We found that
    the Red index had the strongest linear correlation with symbiont cell density
    and chlorophyll content across species (R2 up to 0.97), so that relative changes
    in this color index can be directly interpreted as corresponding changes in tissue
    parameters. To train a model that predicts symbiont densities of a distinct sample
    set using the Red index, we found 10 to 12 samples to be sufficient to achieve
    an accuracy of > 95 % of the models trained on the full datasets. This research
    contributes to improved image analysis as a reliable and non-invasive tool for
    monitoring, by providing guidelines for a systematic use of RGB data to interpret
    coral health.

  description: A major challenge faced by living organisms is adaptation to novel
    environments. This process is poorly understood because monitoring genetic changes
    in natural populations is difficult. One way to simplify the task is to focus
    on organisms that can be studied in captivity under conditions that remain largely
    natural. Feather lice (Insecta, Phthiraptera, Ischnocera) are host-specific parasites
    of birds that live, feed, and breed solely on feathers. Birds defend themselves
    against lice, which damage feathers, by killing them with their beaks during bouts
    of preening. In response, feather lice have evolved background-matching cryptic
    coloration to help them avoid preening. We experimentally manipulated the color
    backgrounds of host-specific pigeon lice (Columbicola columbae) by confining them
    to different colored breeds of rock pigeon (Columba livia) over a period of four
    years (ca. 60 louse generations). Over the course of the experiment, we sampled
    lice from pigeons every six months for genomic resequencing, and then calculated
    allele frequency differences and trajectories to identify putative genomic sites
    under selection. We documented many loci that changed in response to selection
    for color. Most loci putatively under selection were unshared among replicate
    populations of lice, indicating that independent adaptation of distinct lineages
    to the same novel environment resulted in similar phenotypes driven by different
    genotypes.

  description: It is well established that the color of a chicken's shank is primarily
    determined by four genetic loci. Among these, the Inhibition of dermal melanin
    (ID) locus, which suppresses black pigmentation in the dermal layer of the shank,
    is the sole sex-linked mutation and its molecular mechanisms remained elusive.
    In this study, a resource family with segregating shank colors was constructed.
    A genome-wide association study utilizing FarmCPU software identified a top-associated
    SNP located on the Z chromosome. Subsequent linkage mapping further refined the
    candidate region, enabling the screening of the candidate structural variation.
    The candidate structural variation is associated with the yellow shank and characterized
    by a 143 bp deletion accompanied by a 2 bp insertion. Within the same Topologically
    Associating Domain, only the CDKN2A gene showed differential expression. Functional
    studies, including CRISPR/Cas9-edited cells, provided evidence that this mutation
    regulates CDKN2A transcription and is responsible for the ID shank color in chickens.
    The absence of melanocytes is likely due to their apoptosis. This study completes
    the puzzle of chicken shank color genetics and paves the way for the application
    of the ID mutation in the auto-sexing of chicks which is intensively needed in
    layer and broiler industries.

  description: 'Flower coloration arises primarily from pigments that serve dual functions:
    attracting pollinators and mitigating environmental stresses. Among major flower
    pigment groups, anthocyanins and UV-absorbing phenylpropanoids are particularly
    notable for fulfilling both roles. Their importance suggests that both pigment
    types should be widespread in flowers. Here, we analyze the UV-Vis absorption
    profiles of major floral pigments to assess their potential protective role against
    UV radiation and demonstrate that this protection is largely confined to UV-absorbing
    phenylpropanoids. We also analyzed the floral pigment composition of 926 animal-pollinated
    species from California, southern Spain, and southeastern Brazil. UV-absorbing
    phenylpropanoids were ubiquitous, while anthocyanins occurred in ~56% of species,
    carotenoids in ~37%, and chlorophylls in ~17%. Pigment frequencies varied with
    abiotic and biotic factors, such as light environment in Spain, and pollinator
    type, such as insect versus hummingbird, in California. Despite these local differences,
    our findings reveal a consistent regional distribution of floral pigments.'

  description: Rhodamine dyes are widely used fluorophores in super-resolution fluorescence
    imaging due to their exceptional optical properties and "aggregation-disaggregation"
    induced fluorogenic activation. However, their excessive lipophilicity often reduces
    brightness in aqueous environments and causes off-target staining, limiting their
    effectiveness in high-resolution imaging. To address these challenges, we introduce
    an ether-decorated N-terminal modification strategy for rhodamine and silicon-rhodamine
    (Si-rhodamine), replacing conventional N-alkyl groups. The ether chains enhance
    water solubility, decrease aggregate size, and improve fluorogenicity across a
    wide concentration range. Their flexible, hydrophilic structure forms a protective
    shield around the xanthene core, minimizing dye-water interactions and reducing
    fluorescence quenching. Additionally, the inductive effect of the ether chains
    decreases the electron-donating strength of the amino groups, suppressing quenching
    caused by twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT). These modifications collectively
    increase the quantum yields of ER and ESiR in water from 0.35 and 0.19 (for tetraethyl-substituted
    analogs) to 0.70 and 0.41, respectively. Probes derived from ER and ESiR exhibit
    outstanding fluorogenicity, enhanced signal-to-noise ratios, and improved resolution
    in complex aqueous environments, demonstrating superior performance in advanced
    super-resolution imaging techniques such as structured illumination microscopy
    (SIM), stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, and single-molecule localization
    microscopy (SMLM). This work introduces an innovative strategy for fluorophore
    design, offering significant advancements for super-resolution imaging applications.

  description: The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms a monolayer of cells at
    the blood:retina interface that plays important roles for photoreceptor renewal
    and function and is central to retinal health. RPE pigment is provided by melanin-containing
    melanosomes which offer protection against light and oxidative stress. Melanosome
    migration into the apical processes of the RPE following light onset is thought
    to contribute to preventing retinal degeneration with age, though the mechanism
    is not yet clear. Melanosomes are transported along microtubules to the apical
    surface where they are transferred to actin filaments within the apical processes.
    Melanosomes are lysosome-related organelles derived from endosomes and endosome
    transport along microtubules is heavily influenced by the endoplasmic reticulum
    (ER) through ER:endosome contact sites. Here we describe extensive connection
    between the ER and melanosomes in the RPE. We further show, in skin melanocytes,
    that the ER forms contact sites with all stages of melanosome maturation, but
    ER contact is reduced as melanosomes mature. Finally, we identify tripartite contact
    sites between the ER, melanosomes and mitochondria in both RPE tissue and cellular
    models, suggesting that the ER may influence melanosome biogenesis, maturation
    and interaction with mitochondria.

  description: Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is an epithelial monolayer located
    at the back of the eye. RPE and retina interact closely, with RPE performing multiple
    tasks ensuring proper retinal physiology and forming a tight, interlocked structure
    with photoreceptor outer segments (POS). Especially, RPE participates in the essential
    daily renewal of POS in a phagocytosis process. However, current RPE in vitro
    cell culture systems lack the contact between RPE and retina, possibly limiting
    not only RPE maturation but also hindering the studies addressing the RPE-retina
    interface. We constructed a retina-mimicking structure from a soft polyacrylamide
    hydrogel with Matrigel coating and introduced it to RPE cells' apical side during
    culturing to model the RPE-retina interface in vitro. RPE cells adhered to the
    hydrogels during culture, enabling further studies of the biophysical properties
    of the RPE-hydrogel interface with methods utilizing rheology and traction force
    microscopy. During phagocytosis, RPE cells generated considerable traction forces
    that were followed using a hydrogel coated with POS particles. Disruption of RPE's
    actin cytoskeleton with Cytochalasin D significantly reduced the force generation.
    These results support the view of RPE as a mechanically active partner for retina.
    In addition, our retina-mimicking structure offers a tool for further biophysical
    modeling of the RPE-retina interface.

  description: The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) surrounds the posterior eye and
    maintains the health and function of the photoreceptors. Consequently, RPE dysfunction
    or damage has a devastating impact on vision. Due to complex etiologies, there
    are currently no cures for patients with RPE degenerative diseases, which remain
    some of the most prevalent causes of vision loss worldwide. Further, owing to
    a limited capacity for mammalian tissue repair, we know little about how the RPE
    regenerates. Here, we utilize zebrafish as a model to uncover novel mechanisms
    driving intrinsic RPE regeneration. We show that interleukin-34 signaling from
    damaged RPE is required for precisely timed recruitment of mononuclear phagocytes
    (MNPs) to the injury site. Additionally, we find that cellular debris clearance
    by MNPs is indispensable for regeneration, as microglia-deficient zebrafish fail
    to regenerate RPE and photoreceptor tissues. Together, our results establish specific
    pro-regenerative functions of MNPs after RPE damage.

    Here, we introduce an approach for visualizing individual microrobots in real-time

    enables the simultaneous localization and activation of bubble-based microrobots

  description: Structural colors (SC), generated by light interacting with nanostructured

    Despite being widespread within the tree of life, there is little knowledge of
    the genes involved. Partial exceptions are some Flavobacteriia in which genes
    involved in a number of pathways, including gliding motility and polysaccharide
    metabolism, have been linked to SC. A previous genomic analysis of SC and non-SC
    bacteria suggested that the pterin pathway is involved in the organization of
    bacteria to form SC. Thus here, we focus on the moe A molybdopterin molybdenum
    transferase. When this gene was deleted from Flavobacterium IR1, the knock-out
    mutant showed a strong blue shift in SC of the colony, different from the green
    SC of the wild-type. The moe A mutant showed a particularly strong blue shift
    when grown on kappa-carrageenan and was upregulated for starch degradation. To
    further analyze the molecular changes, proteomic analysis was performed, showing
    the upregulation of various polysaccharide utilization loci, which supported the
    link between moe A and polysaccharide metabolism in SC. Overall, we demonstrated
    that single-gene mutations could change the optical properties of bacterial SC,
    which is unprecedented when compared to multicellular organisms where structural
    color is the result of several genes and can not yet be addressed genetically.

  description: Anuran larvae can change their coloration and morphology to avoid predation.
    Particularly, some tadpoles in the genus Dryophytes in the Americas develop deep
    tail fins and bright orange tail coloration in response to predators such as dragonfly
    nymphs. These conspicuous tails are hypothesized to attract predator attacks,
    protecting vital body parts from fatal injuries. However, it remains unclear whether
    the extent of the induced phenotypic changes differs between various predators
    with distinct feeding patterns and habitats. To explore this, we reared tadpoles
    of the Japanese tree frog, Dryophytes japonicus, with four dragonfly species,
    water bug, water scorpion, or newt, and measured phenotypic changes, especially
    focusing on tail coloration. We found that the aeshnid Anax nigrofasciatus, a
    sit-and-wait predator that climbs on aquatic vegetation, induced bright orange
    and broad tails of tadpoles. Other odonate species that forage in and on the substrate
    also elicited tail coloration or deeper larval tails, but it took more time to
    induce the tadpoles' response compared to A. nigrofasciatus. In contrast, non-odonate
    predators did not induce color and morphological changes. This study provides
    the first evidence of predator-induced tail coloration in an Asian species of
    Dryophytes, which appears to be a defensive response specifically to dragonfly
    nymphs, as visually adept predators. Moreover, the differences in the extent and
    timing of the phenotypic changes among odonate species suggest that anti-predator
    phenotypes are modulated based on relative predation risks, considering the predators'
    foraging patterns and visual capabilities, thereby allowing tadpoles to minimize
    physiological costs and unintended risks associated with the induced traits.

  description: 'Competition between phytoplankton species for light has triggered
    an extensive diversification of photosynthetic pigments. In Synechococcus cyanobacteria,
    three major pigment types occur in the ocean: blue light (BL) specialists that
    have a high ratio of the BL-absorbing chromophore phycourobilin (PUB) to the green
    light (GL)-absorbing chromophore phycoerythrobilin (PEB), GL specialists that
    have a low PUB:PEB ratio, and cells that modify their PUB:PEB ratio to match the
    ambient color, a process called  Type IV chromatic acclimation (CA4). The abundance
    of CA4-capable cells in marine ecosystems suggests that CA4 confers a fitness
    advantage in certain light conditions compared to cells with fixed pigmentation.
    This hypothesis was tested by performing mono- and co-cultures of a BL specialist,
    a GL specialist and a CA4-capable strain in chemostats under different light conditions.
    Monocultures enabled us to parameterize a resource competition model that was
    used to predict competition between the three pigment types in co-cultures. In
    line with the model predictions, the BL specialist won in low blue light and the
    GL specialist won in low and high green light. Interestingly, we found that while
    the CA4-capable strain was at a disadvantage at low light, it was able to outcompete
    specialists in high blue light.'

  description: 'This study investigates the mechanisms underlying colour production
    in the family Coccinellidae, focusing on two model species: A. bipunctata (L)
    and C. quatuordecimguttata (L). In this family, colours have traditionally been
    attributed primarily to pigments such as carotenoids and melanins. We propose
    an alternative perspective, considering the elytra as an integrated optical medium
    whose optical properties result from both its architectural design and the properties
    of its constituent materials, including matrix and pigments. In the present work,
    several methods were used, ranging from optical and electron microscopies, light-based
    techniques, to LC-HRMS analyses. Through local pigment analyses, microstructural
    examination of elytra, and modelling of interaction of elytra with light, we show
    that, while pigments are central to patterning and contribute to colour, overall
    colour also results from one or more physical mechanisms that may operate simultaneously.
    In the light of these results, we assume that the complex and diverse colouration
    in the Coccinellidae can only be elucidated by considering the interplay of pigments
    and the optical properties of the elytron cuticle.'

  description: Gene duplication and structural rearrangements have played a pivotal
    role in plant genome evolution, enabling functional divergence and the development
    of novel traits. In soybeans (Glycine max), the I locus, which regulates seed
    color through tissue-specific subfunctionalization of sRNA loci, offers an example
    of these mechanisms. Using long-read sequencing, we investigated structural variations
    underlying four major alleles (I, ii, ik, and i) at the I locus. Our study revealed
    that large-scale rearrangements, including duplications, inversions, and deletions,
    within a 180-kb CHS repeat-rich region drive allele-specific RNA silencing through
    small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The dominant I allele contains a cis-regulatory
    region of DnaJ upstream of CHS genes, while the ii and ik alleles feature subtilisin-
    and P450-driven siRNA loci, respectively. The recessive i allele lacks siRNA production
    due to deletions or inversions disrupting CHS gene clusters. Phenotypic analyses
    and RNA-seq confirmed allele-specific, tissue-dependent expression of siRNAs correlating
    with seed coat pigmentation patterns. This study highlights the evolutionary role
    of repeat-rich regions in generating regulatory innovations and phenotypic diversity.
    Our findings underscore the importance of structural rearrangements in domestication
    traits and demonstrate the power of long-read sequencing for resolving complex
    genomic regions, advancing both evolutionary biology and crop improvement.

  description: If you think that high-pitched sounds match bright colours more than
    dark ones, you are not alone. Spontaneous associations between different sensory
    modalities -crossmodal associations- are widely observed in humans. More recently,
    crossmodal associations have been reported in chimpanzees, monkeys, dogs, chickens,
    and tortoises, indicating a general cognitive strategy that reflects natural correlations
    in the environment or similarities in the architecture of the nervous system.
    Alternatively, or complementarily, crossmodal associations may arise from learning
    of species-specific occurrences. Recent research on primates has tentatively linked
    human pitch-luminance associations to the evolution of language. While humans
    and chimpanzees spontaneously match a high-pitched sound with a white shape and
    a low-pitched sound with a black shape, baboons and chickens do not exhibit any
    preferential association. Identifying spontaneous pitch-luminance associations
    in species that do not rely on vocal communication, such as the solitary Hermann's
    tortoises, would support the idea of a language-independent phenomenon. To test
    this idea, we studied tortoises for pitch-luminance associations in a spontaneous
    food-searching task. After hearing a high-pitched (700 Hz) vs low-pitched (450
    Hz) sound, animals could choose to search for food behind either a light- or dark-coloured
    wall. When hearing the high-pitched sound, tortoises chose the white stimulus,
    whereas when hearing the low-pitched sound, they chose the black stimulus, similarly
    to what humans and chimpanzees do. These results demonstrate crossmodal pitch-luminance
    associations in tortoises. While showing this commonality in the perceptual organization
    of phylogenetically distant species, we shift the question on whether pitch-luminance
    associations reflect homology or convergent evolution.

    cells, closely resembling healthy RPE, offer valuable insights for retinal disease
    modelling. This study evaluates immature and mature phenotypes of iPSC-RPE and
    ARPE-19 cells, comparing RPE characteristics, cell-associated complement profiles,
    and TGF-{beta}1-mediated stress responses across transcript expression, secretion,
    and protein levels. Statistical analyses were performed using independent means
    t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Mature iPSC-RPE cells exhibited characteristic
    RPE-morphology, with elevated secretion of complement components (C3, FH/FHL-1,
    FI), unique FB secretion, and apical complement localisation. Intracellular C3
    processing revealed cleavage products different from known blood-derived C3 fragments
    and showed maturation-dependent differences; only mature iPSC-RPE cells secreted
    active C3 forms (C3(H2O), C3a) and exhibited the intact C3 {beta}-chain. Mature
    ARPE-19 and iPSC-RPE cells demonstrated resistance to TGF-{beta}1 treatment, which
    reduced complement secretion without affecting C3a release. In conclusion, ARPE-19
    and iPSC-RPE cells demonstrated local production of complement components and
    maturation-dependent intracellular processing of C3 into active forms. These findings
    highlight the impact of RPE maturation on local C3 activation, providing a basis
    for future studies on C3 functionality in the RPE and its potential pathological
    effects.

  description: Batesian mimics, such as hoverflies, can gain protection by resembling
    noxious species that predators avoid, such as bees. Such resemblance can be behavioural
    as well as morphological. Bees commonly have a preference for blue flowers, whilst
    flies generally prefer yellow and white. We predicted that, driven by selection
    for enhanced mimicry, bee-mimicking hoverflies would have switched flower preference
    from yellow to blue, to follow the flower choices of their models. We gathered
    internet photographs of flower-visiting bees and wasps, their hoverfly mimics,
    and non-mimicking hoverflies, and compared the colours of the visited flowers.
    Flowers visited by bumblebees were "bluer" than those visited by other hymenopterans
    (honeybees, wasps and solitary bees). Correspondingly, flowers visited by bumblebee-mimicking
    hoverflies were bluer than those visited by non-mimics, and were indistinguishable
    in blueness from those visited by bumblebees. There was no such pattern in flower
    "yellowness", where all flies and most hymenopterans preferred similar yellowness,
    and only bumblebees chose less yellow flowers than the others. Our study demonstrates
    widespread changes in microhabitat choice (specifically flower preference) among
    a diverse group of Batesian mimics, consistent with the idea of behavioural mimicry.
    Mildly noxious models such as bumblebees are thought to exert particularly strong
    selection for mimetic accuracy, suggesting that habitat-choice mimicry may be
    selected as a way of enhancing morphological mimicry.

  description: Bees play important roles in shaping ecosystems through processes like
    pollination. However, their populations are in decline due to habitat degradation
    and unsustainable agriculture. This study assesses the effectiveness of color
    traps for bee monitoring in two distinct yet geographically close habitats in
    \"Jenaer Forst\" natural reserve in Germany. Over a 23-week period in spring and
    summer 2023, we tested six trap colors (blue, yellow, white, violet, blue-yellow,
    and violet-white) and analyzed their performance in terms of bee abundance, diversity,
    and species composition. Our results indicate that violet and blue-yellow traps
    captured the highest bee abundance and species richness. While overall bee community
    composition did not differ significantly between trap colors, specific species
    showed color preferences. The blue-yellow trap emerged as a versatile option,
    potentially capturing a diverse range of species through its contrasting colors.
    Moreover, despite the close proximity of the two sites, differences in community
    composition suggest that habitat-specific factors influence bee color preferences.
    Minor habitat changes significantly impacted trap effectiveness, emphasizing the
    importance of tailored trap designs. These findings highlight the importance of
    considering both color contrast and habitat context when designing bee monitoring
    strategies and understanding bee foraging behavior. This study contributes valuable
    insights to improve trap designs and enhance our understanding of the interactions
    between bees and their environments.

  description: Decapod Iridescent Virus 1 (DIV1) is a highly pathogenic virus threatening
    crustacean aquaculture. Hemocytes, the primary immune cells in shrimp, play crucial
    roles in host defense, yet their transcriptional heterogeneity and differentiation
    dynamics under viral infection remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize
    hemocyte subpopulations in Macrobrachium rosenbergii before and after DIV1 infection
    at single-cell resolution. We identified 12 distinct hemocyte clusters with unique
    molecular signatures. DIV1 infection induced significant shifts in hemocyte composition,
    with clusters 0, 5, 6, and 8 expanding, while clusters 9 and 10 exhibited resistance.
    Clusters 0, 5, and 8 were highly susceptible, showing elevated viral gene expression.
    Pseudo-time analysis revealed that DIV1 accelerates hemocyte differentiation,
    driving prohemocytes and semi-granulocytes toward terminally differentiated granulocytes
    and hyalinocytes, particularly the immune-active HC4 subpopulation. Functional
    enrichment analysis showed that susceptible hemocytes were associated with viral
    processes, oxidative stress, and phagocytosis, while resistant clusters exhibited
    distinct immune signatures. Furthermore, knockdown experiments confirmed the antiviral
    roles of PPO2, RAB11B, LAMP1, and Dorsal, as their silencing led to increased
    viral loads, higher MCP protein levels, and reduced shrimp survival. Taken together,
    our study provides the first single-cell resolution atlas of shrimp hemocytes
    under DIV1 infection, revealing their transcriptional heterogeneity, differentiation
    trajectories, and immune responses. These findings offer novel insights into shrimp
    antiviral immunity and lay the foundation for disease-resistant breeding and immunostimulatory
    strategies in aquaculture.

  description: Sexual conflict over mating has been documented in many species, both
    in the field and in experimental studies. In pond damselflies (family Coenagrionidae),
    sexual conflict maintains heritable female colour polymorphisms, with one female
    morph typically being a male mimic. However, it is not known whether sexual conflict
    can also explain the evolutionary origin of female-limited colour morphs, and
    if so, what ecological factors play a role in this macroevolutionary transition,
    by modulating the strength of the conflict. Furthermore, the effects of sexual
    conflict on phylogenetic diversification remain controversial, in particular,
    whether sexual conflict elevates speciation rates, extinction rates, or both.
    Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to show that female colour polymorphisms
    are more likely to evolve when population densities at breeding sites are high,
    and that these demographic conditions are more common at high latitudes and in
    open landscapes. We show that female-limited polymorphisms typically evolve from
    sexually dimorphic ancestors through the addition of a male-like female morph,
    consistent with the hypothesis of selection for male mimicry. Female colour polymorphisms
    increase both speciation and extinction rates, leading to higher evolutionary
    turnover of polymorphic lineages. We conclude that female colour polymorphisms
    evolve in a predictable fashion, and are likely driven by ecological conditions
    that increase the rate of pre-mating interactions and thus the intensity of sexual
    conflict. The effects of female colour polymorphisms on extinction differ from
    previous intraspecific studies and indicate contrasting long-term effects of sexual
    conflict at micro- and macroevolutionary scales.

  description: The distribution of long-wavelength sensitive (L) and middle-wavelength
    sensitive (M) cones in the retina determines how different frequencies of incident
    light are sampled across space, and has been hypothesized to influence spatial
    and color vision. We asked whether the detection and color naming of small, short-duration
    increment stimuli depend on the relative numbers of L and M cones illuminated.
    Stimuli were corrected for optical aberrations by an adaptive optics system, and
    targeted to locations in the parafovea where cone spectral types were known. We
    found that sensitivity to 680 nm light, normalized by sensitivity to 543 nm light,
    grew with the proportion of L cones at the stimulated locus, though intra- and
    intersubject variability was considerable. A similar trend was derived from a
    simple model of the achromatic (L+M) pathway, as well as from photoreceptor-level
    ideal observers, suggesting that small spot detection mainly relies on a non-opponent
    mechanism. Most stimuli were called achromatic, with red and green responses becoming
    more common as stimulus intensity and local L/M ratio symmetry increased. Our
    detection data confirm earlier reports that small spot psychophysics can reveal
    information about local cone topography, and our color naming findings suggest
    that chromatic sensitivity may improve when the L/M ratio approaches unity.

  description: Fluorescent imaging enables visualization of the specific molecules
    of interest with high contrast, and the use of multiple fluorophores in a single
    tissue sample allows visualization of complex relationships between biological
    molecules, cell types, and anatomy. The utility of fluorescent imaging in human
    tissue has been limited by endogenous pigments that can block the light path or
    emit an autofluorescence, thereby interfering with the specific imaging of target
    molecules. Although photobleachers have been developed to quench endogenous pigments,
    the lack of customizability limits their utility for a broad range of applications.
    Here, we present a high luminous-intensity photobleacher that is based on rigorous
    simulations of illumination patterns using the laws of radiation, along with the
    framework to maximize bleaching efficiency. This open-source project is designed
    to help researchers customize and scale according to the tissue types and the
    research goals. The photobleacher is applicable to both thin tissue slices and
    large-volume cleared tissue samples to enable serial three-dimensional imaging
    of postmortem human brain using multiplexed antibody or oligonucleotide probes.

  description: Light scattering in biological tissue presents a significant challenge
    for deep in vivo imaging. Our previous work demonstrated the ability to achieve
    optical transparency in live mice using intensely absorbing dye molecules, which
    created transparency in the red spectrum while blocking shorter-wavelength photons.
    In this paper, we extend this capability to achieve optical transparency across
    the entire visible spectrum by employing molecules with strong absorption in the
    ultraviolet spectrum and sharp absorption edges that rapidly decline upon entering
    the visible spectrum. This new color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency
    method enables optical transparency for imaging commonly used fluorophores in
    the green and yellow spectra. Notably, this approach facilitates tissue transparency
    for structural and functional imaging of the live mouse brain labeled with yellow
    fluorescent protein and GCaMP through the scalp and skull. We show that this method
    enables longitudinal imaging of the same brain regions in awake mice over multiple
    days during development. Histological analyses of the skin and systemic toxicology
    studies indicate minimal acute or chronic damage to the skin or body using this
    approach. This color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency technique opens
    new opportunities for noninvasive deep-tissue optical imaging, enabling long term
    visualization of cellular structures and dynamic activity with high spatiotemporal
    resolution and chronic tracking capabilities.

  description: Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized high-resolution
    imaging, but the simultaneous detection of multiple fluorophores traditionally
    relies on spectral-based separation, which is inherently constrained by spectral
    overlap. Here, we introduce Brightness Demixing, a novel method for fluorophore
    discrimination that exploits brightness, which directly depends on the fluorophore's
    extinction coefficient and quantum yield. By oversampling blinking events, we
    precisely quantify photon flux as a proxy for brightness, enabling robust differentiation
    of fluorophores independent of their spectral properties, without requiring additional
    spectral separation. Brightness Demixing operates within a single detection channel,
    eliminating the need for additional spectral filters or cameras. We demonstrate
    this approach with simultaneous two- and three-target imaging in both 2D and 3D
    configurations. By maintaining single-wavelength excitation and minimizing chromatic
    aberrations, this method significantly enhances multiplexing in SMLM while remaining
    fully compatible with existing setups. Brightness Demixing thus offers a simple
    yet powerful approach for expanding multi-target imaging capabilities in super-resolution
    microscopy

  description: Lakes experience a wide range of variation in resource availability;
    variation of essential resources such as light and nutrients can cause changes
    in algae community structure. Changes in light color and nutrient availability
    could lead to shifts in algal community diversity and composition, including shifting
    communities to be dominated by cyanobacteria. Due to eutrophication and brownification,
    lakes are experiencing increases in nutrient concentrations and shifts from blue
    towards red in the color of light available to algae for photosynthesis. We investigated
    whether differences in light color and nutrients affect algal community composition
    and diversity, and whether differences in light color alter the impact that nutrient
    levels have on algal communities. We used experimental microcosms with a fully
    factorial experimental design, crossing four light colors with two nutrient levels.
    We assessed community composition by enumerating algal taxa via light microscopy.
    We found that light color and the interaction between light color and nutrient
    availability led to large differences in community diversity, with blue light
    leading to the greatest diversity and broad light the lowest. Light color, nutrients,
    and the interaction between the two were all significant drivers of differences
    in community composition. Overall, we found that light color and nutrient availability
    interact to affect algal community diversity, composition, and cyanobacteria density.
    Consequences of light color are infrequently studied in aquatic ecology, but our
    results show that light color may need to be considered more broadly. Furthermore,
    our results suggest that concurrent eutrophication and brownification may yield
    environmental conditions favorable to cyanobacteria, including taxa that can form
    harmful algal blooms.

  description: Color vision is vital for animal survival, essential for foraging and
    predator detection. In mice, as in other mammals, color vision originates in the
    retina, where photoreceptor signals are processed by neural circuits. However,
    retinal responses to stimuli involving multiple colors are still not well understood.
    One possible explanation of this knowledge gap is that previous studies have not
    thoroughly examined how neuronal activity adapts to a 30 seconds to a few minutes
    timescale when exposed to multiple color sources. To address this, we systematically
    varied the UV-to-green light balance with a custom-built stimulator targeting
    mice opsins spectra while recording retinal ganglion cell responses in the ventral
    retina using multielectrode arrays. Responses to full-field chirp and checkerboard
    stimulations with alternating UV and green light revealed that more than one order
    of magnitude of intensity difference favoring green M-opsin over UV S-opsin is
    needed for a balanced reliability in retinal ganglion cell responses. An incorrect
    balance, with slightly increased UV light, silenced responses to green illumination.
    To determine if these values are consistent with natural conditions, we analyzed
    isomerisation rates in the mouse retina across different times of the day. We
    found that the M- to S-opsin activation ratio remains constant through the mesopic-photopic
    range, and our empirically determined values align well with these natural conditions,
    lying far from a simple equalization of M- and S-opsin isomerisation rates. In
    conclusion, a finely tuned color intensity balance is essential for accurately
    measuring both fast temporal responses and detailed spatial receptive fields.

  description: 'Significance: Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) enables
    neuroimaging in scenarios where other modalities are less suitable, such as during
    motion tasks or in low-resource environments. Sparse fNIRS arrays with 30mm channel
    spacing are widely used but have limited spatial resolution. High-density (HD)
    arrays with overlapping, multi-distance channels improve sensitivity and localization
    but increase costs and setup times. A statistical comparison of HD and sparse
    arrays is needed for evaluating the benefits and trade-offs of HD arrays. Aim:
    This study provides a statistical comparison of HD and sparse fNIRS performance
    to inform array selection in future research. Approach: We measured prefrontal
    cortex (PFC) activation during congruent and incongruent Word-Color Stroop (WCS)
    tasks using both Sparse and HD arrays for 17 healthy adult participants, comparing
    dorsolateral PFC channel and image results at the group level. Results: While
    both arrays detected activation in channel space during incongruent WCS, channel
    and image space results demonstrated superior localization and sensitivity with
    the HD array for all WCS. Conclusions: Sparse channel data may suitably detect
    activation from cognitively demanding tasks, like incongruent WCS. However, the
    HD array outperformed Sparse in detecting and localizing brain activity in image
    space, particularly during lower cognitive load tasks, making them more suitable
    for neuroimaging applications.'

  description: Exophiala dermatitidis is a polyextremotolerant black yeast species.
    E. dermatitidis produces 1,8 dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin via the Polyketide
    Synthase 1 (PKS1) pathway enabling it to survive harmful conditions. This study
    focused on random mutagenesis to obtain albino (alb) and hyper-pigmented (hyp)
    mutants. Notably, all 17 alb mutants possessed mutations in PKS1 whereas the 133
    hyper-pigmented (hyp) mutants harbored mutations impacting a range of functions.
    Cell morphology and phenotypic assays showed additional differences between the
    alb and hyp mutants. Strikingly, three of the albino mutants (alb1, alb2, and
    alb3) were conditional in that despite the presence of mutations inPKS1 they were
    able to produce melanin upon exposure to different carbon sources. These mutants
    otherwise shared similar cell morphology and growth patterns with the obligate
    albinos. No additional shared mutations were found among the conditional albinos.
    Temperature and UV irradiation assays demonstrated reduced growth of albino mutants
    at higher temperatures (i.e., 42oC) and a greater sensitivity to higher doses
    of UV. Single nucleotide variant (SNVs) calling showed that hyper-pigmented mutants
    had a greater number of SNVs compared to albino strains. To date this is the first
    study to generate and characterize conditional albino mutants in E. dermatitidis
    with the ability to recover melanin production.

  description: An essential objective of early visual processing is to handle the
    redundant inputs from natural environments efficiently. For instance, cone signals
    from natural environments are highly correlated across cone types, indicating
    channel redundancy. Early visual processing transforms the signals into color
    and luminance information, such as principle component analysis, and thus achieves
    efficient and decorrelated representations of natural scenes. Building on these
    findings, previous research has investigated the effect of color on visual tasks
    such as object recognition using grayscale conversion, which separates luminance
    from color. However, recent work suggests that when focusing on object materials,
    color and luminance remain highly redundant due to complex optical properties.
    Although this finding indicates that there may be a more efficient decomposition
    of signals, the specific algorithms remain unknown. This study derives that a
    classic computer graphics algorithm, the median cut, offers a novel approach to
    enhance visual processing efficiency while capturing diagnostic features to separate
    material from object geometry information. Human behavioral experiments show that
    color reduction based on the algorithm disturbs material classification while
    preserving object recognition. These findings suggest that object geometric structures
    are available only from low-bit information. Finally, considering material information
    can be estimated from summary statistics of image sub-spaces, this study suggests
    an efficient decomposition of input color images.

  description: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision
    loss worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified
    dozens of risk loci that may house disease targets. However, variants at these
    loci are largely noncoding, making it difficult to assess their function and whether
    they are causal. Here, we present a single-cell gene expression and chromatin
    accessibility atlas of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid to systematically
    analyze both coding and noncoding variants implicated in AMD. We employ HiChIP
    and Activity-by-Contact modeling to map enhancers in these tissues and predict
    cell and gene targets of risk variants. We further perform allele-specific self-transcribing
    active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) to functionally test variant activity
    in RPE cells, including in the context of complement activation. Our work nominates
    new pathogenic variants and mechanisms in AMD and offers a rich and accessible
    resource for studying diseases of the RPE and choroid.

    The microscope is assembled entirely from commercial parts within 3 hours, making
    the system broadly accessible. Leveraging the improved brightness and bleaching
    characteristics of recent genetically-encoded indicators and fluorophores, the
    simple microscope is even suitable for simultaneous calcium imaging of neurons
    and behavior as we demonstrate in C. elegans. We also show how muscle dynamics
    in D. melanogaster larvae can be analyzed and how dual color fluorescence tracking
    elucidates inter-species interactions by visualizing both predatory nematodes
    and their prey. Finally, we showcase a configuration for bright-field imaging,
    by tracking tardigrade gait as an example of utility for non-model species. The
    affordability of the hardware and ease of use of the accompanying software make
    this a suitable tool for education in addition to its use in research.

  description: 'Realism in augmented reality (AR) hinges on the seamless blending
    of virtual elements into real-world environments. One possible factor influencing
    this realism may be the physical gamut: an internal representation of all perceivable
    colors within a natural scene. Previous studies on luminosity thresholds suggest
    that this gamut, rooted in optimal colors theory, constrains perceptual judgments.
    While promising, such findings were based on abstract and two-dimensional stimuli
    only. Before extending this framework to more realistic AR scenarios, an essential
    next step is to assess whether the physical gamut theory also applies to naturalistic
    stimuli. This study addresses that gap. Our results reveal that the physical gamut
    remains a valid construct for natural objects viewed in realistic scenes. Moreover,
    observers'' judgments of luminosity thresholds appear guided not only by a criterion
    of self-luminosity, but also by an implicit sense of naturalness. These insights
    pave the way for exploring AR realism through the lens of physical gamut theory.'

  description: 'Cryptic colouration is a primary anti-predation strategy in herbivorous
    insects. Achieving crypsis often requires acquiring dietary carotenoids--tetraterpene
    pigments vital for plant colouration and photoprotection. Silicon (Si) accumulation
    in plants makes tissues tougher and less digestible for insects, but its effect
    on plant pigment levels remains unclear. It is also unknown whether feeding on
    silicified plants impairs insects'' ability to sequester carotenoids and achieve
    crypsis. Using the model grass Brachypodium distachyon, we demonstrate that the
    cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) larvae exhibited stunted growth and reduced
    carotenoid sequestration, particularly lutein, into their hemolymph when feeding
    on Si-supplemented (+Si) plants. This reduction led to distinct body-colour morphs:
    larvae feeding on +Si plants developed brown colouration, contrasting sharply
    with the green leaves, whereas larvae feeding on Si-free (-Si) plants exhibited
    green cryptic colouration that blended seamlessly with the foliage. Plant leaves
    contained various carotenoids (neoxanthin, violaxanthin, {beta}-carotene and lutein)
    and chlorophylls (a and b), but larvae only sequestered {beta}-carotene and lutein
    into their haemolymph while excreting substantial amounts of pigments, regardless
    of plant Si status. Under insect-free conditions, +Si plants had lower carotenoid
    and chlorophyll contents than -Si plants. However, following insect herbivory,
    pigment levels in -Si and +Si plants equalised. Insect herbivory also increased
    Si accumulation in +Si plants. Our findings provide novel evidence that plant
    Si defences can disrupt cryptic colouration in insect herbivores by restricting
    carotenoid sequestration from host plant tissues. This disruption could increase
    insect visibility to predators, potentially elevating their risk of predation.'

  description: Theory predicts that traits evolving as animal signals must transmit
    reliable information about the bearer's quality. Two hypotheses are often invoked
    to explain how carotenoid-based colorations function as reliable individual quality
    signals. The first hypothesis suggests that carotenoid allocation trade-offs between
    signaling and survival-related functions maintain signal reliability. Only high-quality
    individuals could resolve these trade-offs without incurring a fitness loss. Such
    signals are plastic, and the signaler can strategically manage their expression
    level to increase fitness returns. The second hypothesis posits that certain carotenoid-based
    signals are strongly constrained in their expression, not allowing strategic manipulations
    or cheating. We challenged captive male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) with
    simulated infections by injecting lipopolysaccharides (LPS) derived from Escherichia
    coli and assessed organ masses, body temperature, and carotenoid levels in several
    tissues. Compared to controls, LPS-treated birds reduced the bill redness, a sexual
    signal. However, this reduction was largely explained by decreased food intake
    caused by LPS. The bill redness was negatively correlated with body temperature
    and spleen mass but positively correlated with blood, spleen and subcutaneous
    fat carotenoid levels. Overall, our findings suggest that carotenoid-based bill
    coloration predominantly reflects the recent physiological condition of individuals
    and resource allocation trade-offs rather than directly signaling individual quality.

    category-specific areas, organized along posterior-to-anterior and medial-to-lateral
    axes. However, the role of regions beyond the VOTC in category-specific processing
    remains less explored. Here, we report the presence of face-, color- and word-specific
    patches in the human orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and systematically describe their
    location, activity amplitude, category selectivity, representational content,
    and functional connectivity. We compare these features with those of corresponding
    VOTC category-specific patches. Our findings reveal that face- and color-specific
    patches in the OFC follow a similar medial-lateral organization to those in the
    VOTC and form continuous functional gradients with VOTC patches. These results

  description: This study investigated how physical luminance and perceived brightness
    affect breakthrough time (BT) under continuous flash suppression (CFS). Experiment
    1 examined whether the glare illusion, which increases subjective brightness without
    altering actual luminance, would shorten BT compared to physically identical controls.
    The results revealed no difference, suggesting that subjective brightness alone
    does not expedite emergence into awareness. Experiment 2 assessed whether the
    partial suppression of the illusion's inducers influenced detection speed and
    revealed that subjective brightness stimuli gained a BT advantage. Experiment
    3 tested participants' ability to discriminate real versus illusory brightness
    while stimuli remained suppressed; performance above chance for both conditions
    indicated that physical and perceived brightness cues were processed unconsciously.
    Together, these findings suggest that contextual brightness illusions are not
    simply lost below awareness, they can be discriminated in unconscious vision.

  description: |-
    PremiseUrbanization can alter the interplay of stochastic genetic drift and natural selection but these effects will depend on the biology and history of a species. To explore the influences of drift and selection we investigated patterns of flower color variation among populations of the introduced ornamental mustard, Hesperis matronalis, along an urban-rural gradient in eastern Ontario Canada.

    MethodsWe surveyed 136 naturalized stands of H. matronalis over three generations, and for each stand estimated the diversity of the three color morphs (white, pink, purple), the number of reproductive plants, and the degree of urbanization based on night sky brightness.

    Key ResultsFlower color morph diversity increased with both stand size and urbanization which is consistent with effects of genetic drift during colonization combined with multiple introductions of this horticultural plant in urban areas. However, the frequency and fixation of the purple morph systematically increased towards the rural end of the gradient. Although lifetime seed production did not vary among morphs, pre-dispersal seed predation by a recently adventive weevil was higher in the purple morph, particularly in rural areas. Estimated seed production in the absence of predation suggests a previous fitness advantage for the purple and pink morphs in rural areas and for the white morph in urban areas.

    ConclusionsRandom variation in flower color diversity may be influenced by stochastic processes and colonization history, while systematic variation in color morph frequencies may reflect past fitness differences among morphs that have been recently erased by seed predation.

  description: Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transplantation surgery has shown
    potential benefits in animal models and early clinical trials. However, current
    implantation techniques are limited by the need for large retinotomies when cell
    bearing scaffolds are used or cellular reflux in the case of cell suspension transplantation
    with micro-cannulae. Here we demonstrate that it is feasible to pass primary and
    stem cell derived RPE cells through microneedles with a bore as small as 30m.
    In vitro, there is no immediate loss of cell viability and this remains true throughout
    14 days of live cell viability monitoring. Further, when the RPE cells are cultured
    over 14 days, they attach within 24 hours and become confluent, with normal morphological
    appearances. The formation of tight junctions is unimpeded with the typical polygonal
    pattern observed. The effects of shear stress due to passage of the cells through
    a small lumen were not evident in cultured cells labelled for the cytoskeletal
    protein F-actin. RPE cell VEGF secretion is unaffected by microneedle size in
    primary RPE and iPSC RPE cells. Ex vivo surgical implantation demonstrates that
    the technique is feasible, RPE cells engraft in the outer retina and we show that
    vitrectomy is not required to successfully transplant cells. Herein, we provide
    the first evidence of surgical microneedle cell delivery, which may have future
    applications more broadly within ophthalmic microsurgery and minimally invasive
    delivery strategies.

    a brightness- and contrast-processing circuit in the zebrafish visual system and
    uncover the role of Leucine-rich repeat neuronal (Lrrn) cell adhesion molecules
    (CAMs) in regulating its assembly. Deep-projecting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)
    serve as the first synaptic relay to the brain requiring Lrrn2 and Lrrn3a for
    precise axonal targeting and connectivity within the optic tectum. Genetic targeting
    of these CAMs leads to circuit disorganization and impairments in contrast sensitivity,
    leading to deficits in visually guided behaviors. Additionally, ultrastructural
    circuit reconstruction and functional imaging analysis revealed their critical
    role in luminance processing. These studies define a fundamental visual processing
    pathway and establish Lrrn CAMs as essential molecular drivers of its assembly.

  description: Fluorescence confocal microscopy is a fundamental and widely used tool
    for biological, medical, and chemical research. It enables color-coded visualization
    of sample components, enhancing our understanding of life's building blocks and
    their interactions. The recent realization of image scanning microscopy (ISM)
    using confocal spinning disks (CSD) enhanced the spatial resolution of fluorescence
    microscopy to twice the diffraction limit with minimal sample perturbation and
    fast acquisition rates. However, capturing multi-color images using ISM is still
    time-consuming and introduces temporal artifacts as different colors are not acquired
    simultaneously. Here, we present a spectral CSD-ISM system designed for concurrent
    high-resolution and simultaneous multi-color acquisition. By integrating a custom
    linear Amici prism into the CSD-ISM optical detection path, we achieve multi-color,
    super-resolution images at a fraction of the acquisition time and with a flexible
    color palette selection. A digital signal processor (DSP) is employed together
    with accompanying software as a cost-effective alternative to Field-Programmable
    Gate Arrays (FPGAs) used in previous studies. We provide an accompanying GPU-compatible,
    python-based image processing pipeline to decompose spectral signatures into multi-color
    channel-based images, preserving the optical resolution. System characterization
    using three color fluorescent beads demonstrated 1.74-fold resolution improvement
    over the diffraction limit and accurate color classification with three times
    faster acquisition compared to standard CSD-ISM. Application to neuron cells expressing
    a Parkinson's disease-associated mutation, showcased improved resolution and contrast
    of four distinctly labeled cellular components. This spectral CSD-ISM system provides
    a valuable tool for biological imaging, enabling the simultaneous acquisition
    of high-resolution spatial information and multi-color spectral data.

  description: Characterizing patterns of trait variation across widespread species
    is a fundamental goal of natural history. Here we create a pipeline to analyze
    a large community science dataset and test hypothesized flower color divergence
    across the range of a widespread wildflower. Monarda fistulosa is a North American
    perennial that produces showy lavender inflorescences. Although previous literature
    suggests that the flowers of western M. fistulosa might display a deeper purple
    color than the eastern varieties, this divergence has not been assessed at scale.
    We process over 40,000 community science photographs of M. fistulosa to identify
    flowers and extract color. We demonstrate that the flowers of the montane western
    variety have lower lightness and higher chroma, corresponding to a deeper violet
    color, than those of eastern M. fistulosa. Our approach and validation provides
    a scalable framework for phenotyping community science images and enables analysis
    of geographic color variation in other widespread species.

  description: The number of reference genomes is rapidly increasing, thanks to advances
    in long-read sequencing and assembly. While these collections can improve the
    sensitivity and specificity of classification methods, this requires highly efficient
    compressed indexes. K-mer-based approaches like Kraken 2 are efficient but limit
    the analysis to a fixed k-mer length. This is hard for the user to set ahead of
    time, and suboptimal settings can harm sensitivity and specificity. Methods that
    use compressed full-text indexes like SPUMONI2 and Cliffy lift this constraint,
    but are less efficient than k-mer-based tools. Further, these methods either cannot
    report a full listing of genomes where a match occurs, or cannot scale to large
    reference databases. We propose new methods and algorithms that use compressed
    full-text indexes to enable multi class and taxonomic classification. Unlike past
    compressed-indexing methods for classification, ours uses the move structure,
    which is extremely fast thanks to its locality of reference. Our method, called
    Movi Color, augments the main table of the Movi index. Specifically, Movi Color
    assigns a "color" to each run of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform according to the
    subset of genomes from which the run suffixes originated. When the reference is
    highly repetitive, as is typical when indexing pangenomes or reference databases,
    only certain colors occur, creating opportunities to compress the index. For species-level
    classification, Movi Color achieves over 1.6x higher precision and 2x higher recall
    than Kraken 2 and Metabuli. At the genus level, it achieves 70% higher precision

  description: The accurate representation of color is important in applications involving
    species identification. Environmental variations introduce inconsistencies in
    color perception, affecting the reliability of automated image processing algorithms.
    In previous work, we developed a hybrid algorithm, AInsectID Version 1.1 Color
    Merge, to overcome challenges posed by over-segmentation and under-segmentation
    in insect wing color clustering. We achieved this by using color differences between
    superpixels to measure homogeneity during the superpixels segmentation process.
    Nevertheless, our algorithm remains sensitive to environmental effects, affecting
    its performance and accuracy in color analyses. Here, we introduce a standard
    imaging method for insect species, as a pre-requisite to analysis in AInsectID
    Version 1.1 Color Merge. We systematically examine the effects of varying lighting
    conditions, angle of observation, and working distance in a controlled environment
    to assess their impact on the performance of the algorithm. We find that by meticulously
    controlling lighting, working distance, and lighting angle, we develop an evidence-based
    standard approach to imaging colors that is robust and repeatable. By following
    our standardized procedure, consistent color analyses are possible under varying
    environmental conditions. The method was tested using the Delta E2000 ({Delta}E)
    color difference metric with a threshold of 1, demonstrating that our standard
    approach maintains perceptual accuracy within the Just Noticeable Difference (JND)
    range, while improving the reliability of color analyses of insect wings in diverse
    environments. Finally, to validate the robustness of our standardization method,
    we evaluated the certainty of our results at different levels of confidence.

  description: Flower colour is recognized as a key trait influencing pollinator visitation
    and behaviour, evolved to match the sensory system of a particular pollinator
    group. However, some flowers combine colours associated with different pollinators,
    suggesting bimodal adaptation. The perennial herb Cyrtanthus obliquus produces
    red corollas with yellow tips and is pollinated by birds, but also by bees. To
    assess the role of the two pollinator categories in shaping selection on the bi-coloured
    corollas, we examined bee choices in arrays in which the colour signals of plants
    had been manipulated, and we quantified total as well as bird-mediated phenotypic
    selection on flower colour using both bird and bee visual models. Bees preferred
    flowers with a yellow signal over all-red flowers. The analysis of phenotypic
    selection indicated that both birds and bees influence net selection on flower
    colour, resulting in conflicting selection on the colour contrast between corolla
    and corolla tip. Our findings show that the optimal phenotype should depend on
    the relative importance of the two categories of pollinators in a given population,
    and are consistent with bimodal adaptation. This study fills an important gap
    by showing that secondary pollinators can contribute to selection on complex colour
    signals in angiosperm flowers.

  description: In near-threshold detection tasks, larger pre-stimulus pupil size is
    associated with improved accuracy. However, previous studies have used black and
    white peripherally presented stimuli, leaving open the question of whether the
    relationship persists when targets differ in their colour or eccentricity. Across
    three experiments (in years 2022-2024), we tested a total of 124 participants
    while systematically varying the lighting conditions and target properties in
    a near-threshold detection task. Light conditions ranged from dark to dim to bright,
    with the dark condition including a period of dark-adaptation. Possible target
    colours were blue and red on a black background (dark condition), blue and red
    on a grey background (dim condition), or yellow and cyan on a white background
    (bright condition). Possible target eccentricities ranged from parafoveal to peripheral,
    in a continuous manner (experiment 3) or as two predefined near and far eccentricities
    (experiments 1 & 2). Across all experiments we show that larger pre-stimulus pupil
    size is associated with improved performance. This large-pupil advantage is not
    modulated by the colour or eccentricity of the targets, the illumination of the
    testing room, or retinal adaptation-state. We conclude that the phenomenon is
    robust, indicating that pupil size affects vision in a behaviourally relevant
    manner, regardless of the exact conditions.

  description: Soybean (Glycine max) has not yet benefited from large-scale hybrid
    breeding efforts due to its small, self-fertilizing flowers that are difficult
    to emasculate and limited attractiveness to pollinators. This study explores targeted
    floral trait engineering to enhance pollinator attraction, aiming to overcome
    barriers to soybean hybridization. We generated a high-resolution floral organ
    expression atlas and H3K4 trimethylation ChIP-Seq dataset to identify candidate
    genes involved in petal development, nectar sugar content, and petal pigmentation.
    Using CRISPR-based activation and repression systems, we modified the expression
    of AINTEGUMENTA (GmANT), BIGPETAL (GmBPE), and SUCROSE TRANSPORTER2 (GmSUC2).
    Contrary to expectations based on Arabidopsis homologs, transcriptional activation
    of GmANT_B and repression of GmBPE led to reduced, rather than increased, petal
    size, highlighting divergent regulatory mechanisms in soybean. Complementation
    of the W1 gene that controls petal pigmentation successfully converted white petals
    to purple, with preliminary evidence indicating that this color conversion may
    increase pollinator visitation. These results underscore the complexity of floral
    development in soybean and provide foundational tools and resources for future
    efforts to engineer reproductive traits for hybrid seed production.

  description: Colors are widely used to report biological research data. Effective
    interpretation of colors relies on accurate, intuitive, and accessible colormaps
    that are properly labeled. Misuse of colormaps, such as using rainbow, mismatched,
    and other inaccessible colormaps, hinders reader interpretation. Despite their
    ubiquitous use to represent biological data, the prevalence of colormap misuse
    has not been quantified. Using established guidelines, we analyzed over 6,000
    articles in 10 high-impact biological journals spanning 2020-2024 to quantify
    the prevalence of colormap use and misuse. Over 67% of articles contain at least
    one colormap, of which 81% contain some form of misuse. Among the over 11,000
    acquired colormap-associated figures, 60% contain some form of misuse. Heatmaps,
    scatter plots, images, and image overlays are the most commonly used figures with
    colormaps. These statistics vary by journal but remain constant over time, demonstrating
    the urgent need to increase awareness and education about color-based data reporting

  description: 'Over a century of research has demonstrated that pollinators, such
    as bees, associatively learn diverse flower cues, including tactile, visual, and
    olfactory cues, to find food rewards. However, floral cues are not always reliable,
    as flowers of different plant species often differ in terms of the qualities of
    their food rewards, even when flower types resemble each other. At the same time,
    some non-floral traits, such as leaf shape, differ reliably among plant species
    and might be associatively learned by bees to improve foraging success. In this
    laboratory study, we tested whether generalist bees (Bombus impatiens) can (1)
    associatively learn differences in leaf shape to discriminate rewarding from unrewarding
    flowers and (2) rely more on differences in leaf shape when a flower color cue
    is harder to discriminate. We therefore assigned bees to either of two treatments:
    in one treatment, rewarding and unrewarding artificial targets ("flowers") differed
    greatly in petal color, and in the other treatment, they differed little; each
    treatment''s targets differed in leaf shape in the same way. As expected, bees
    learned significantly faster when flower petal colors were more dissimilar and
    thus relatively easier to discriminate. These bees also learned and recalled the
    correct combination of petal color and leaf shape. Yet when petal colors differed
    relatively little, bees had a much harder time learning petal color and did not
    show evidence of having remembered leaf shape. Our results demonstrate that leaf
    shape is a cue that foraging bees can learn to associate with a pollen food reward.
    However, leaf shape may be learned secondarily to, or only in combination with
    floral cues (such as petal color). We discuss evidence of compound learning and
    overshadowing and implications of our results for pollinator-mediated selection
    on non-floral plant traits.'

  description: Lysosomal pH is frequently elevated in age-dependent neurodegenerations
    like Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and Parkinson's
    Disease (PD). Tools that restore lysosomal pH to an optimal acidic range could
    enhance enzymatic degradation and reduce waste accumulation. Acidic nanoparticles
    offer a promising strategy for restoring lysosomal function, but accurate tracking
    of organelle delivery and long-term retention is needed to optimize dosage. To
    improve detection and enhance delivery, nanoparticles were synthesized from Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)
    (PLGA) polymers covalently linked to the fluorescent Cyanine3 amine (Cy3) probe.
    Nanoparticle concentration and loading times were optimized to achieve >90% delivery
    to lysosomes in cultured induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment
    epithelial (iPS-RPE) cells. Uptake was heterogeneous, varying between adjacent
    cells. Once loaded into lysosomes, the nanoparticles were stably retained, with
    no detectable changes in concentration, distribution, or size for at least 28
    days. iPS-RPE cells internalized more nanoparticles than the ARPE-19 cell line
    or mouse optic nerve head astrocyte cultures. Functionally, PLGA nanoparticles
    restored an acidic pH and cathepsin D levels in compromised lysosomes. In summary,
    Cy3-PLGA nanoparticles enabled improved tracking and long-term delivery to lysosomes,
    supporting future in vivo applications to restore lysosomal pH in aging and degenerating
    tissues.

  description: Body color plays key roles in fitness, communication with others, and
    hiding. In poikilothermal vertebrates, the body color is mainly determined by
    types and distributions of chromatophores. Among them, carotenoid color of xanthophores/erythrophores
    is important for interspecific diversity and colorful males as sexual dimorphism.
    Most vertebrates cannot synthesize carotenoids in their bodies and must ingest
    them from food. However, the genes involved in the uptake process are not fully
    understood. Therefore, we tried to identify the causal gene of the carotenoid
    color mutant of medaka. The HdrR-II1 strain used in the genome project has orange
    body color in males and white body color in females. The orange and white body
    color was known to be controlled by the sex-linked R locus, but the causal gene
    of this was unknown. In this study, we identified that the causal gene of the
    R locus is tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39b like (ttc39bl). In the HdrR-II1,
    the ttc39bl on the Y chromosome is normal, but the ttc39bl on the X chromosome
    has an 821 bases insertion in exon 3 and is broken. This insertion is also present
    on both the X and Y chromosomes of commercially available white medaka.

  description: Geographic atrophy or late stage dry age-related macular degeneration
    (AMD) is characterized by drusen deposition and progressive retinal pigment epithelium
    (RPE) degeneration, leading to irreversible vision loss. The formation of drusen
    leads to dyshomeostasis, oxidative stress and irreversible damage to RPE. In this
    study, we used an in vitro model of oxidized-low density lipoproteins (ox-LDL)
    induced human RPE damage/death model to investigate the mechanism whereby a sterically
    hindered phenol antioxidant compound, PMC (2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-chromanol)
    protects RPE against ox-LDL-induced damage. We show that PMC exerts its protective
    effect by preventing the upregulation of stress-responsive heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1/HO-1)
    and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) at mRNA and protein levels. This effect
    was due to PMC mediated blockade of ROS generation, which in turn blocked nuclear
    translocation of the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription
    factor, ultimately preventing the upregulation of antioxidant response elements
    (ARE), including HMOX1 and NQO1. A key role for HO-1 was demonstrated when the
    protective effect of PMC was inhibited by the knockdown of HMOX1. Additionally,
    treatment of PMC under different experimental conditions and time points revealed
    that the continuous presence of PMC is required for optimal protection against
    ox-LDL-induced cytotoxicity, defining the cellular pharmacokinetics of the molecule.
    Our data demonstrate the involvement of a key antioxidant pathway through which
    PMC mitigates oxidative stress induced by ox-LDL and provides a potential therapeutic
    strategy to suppress RPE degeneration/damage during AMD progression.

  description: Visual learning in insects can be strongly influenced by the underlying
    context and conditions. Improved colour learning has been demonstrated using differential
    conditioning with reward-aversion paradigms in insects like wasps, bumblebees,
    and honeybees, where substances that induce strong aversion, such as quinine,
    enable more accurate discrimination. Although learning outcomes of differential
    conditioning are closely tied to the perceived reward and aversion, few studies
    have compared the role of negative reinforcements in shaping associations, and
    their relevance across insect groups. In our study, we compare the role of aversive
    substances for differential in the hummingbird hawkmoth, Macroglossum stellatarum,
    a diurnal moth that relies on vision for foraging. Tying to previous learning
    studies in insects, we paired a sugar-rewarded target with a distractor that was
    paired with either quinine, salt, citric acid, water, or was presented with no
    aversive substance. Learning outcomes were compared by inverting a strong colour
    preference between perceptually close or distant colour pairs, to provide tasks
    with disparate challenges. Contrary to results from other insect species, we found
    that moths trained with quinine were worse at switching preferences between similar
    colours compared to training with citric acid and appetitive-only differential
    conditioning. We also show that quinine interferes with sucrose perception, potentially
    impairing target acquisition during training. Additionally, we link differences
    in learning arising from the negative reinforcements to their impact on exploration
    during foraging. Our results highlight the role of experience in modulating behaviour
    and discuss the importance of interpreting learning outcomes based on an animal's
    sensory ecology and foraging dynamics.

  description: The explanation of the variation in ecological success of species is
    one of the key challenges in ecology, evolutionary biology and conservation biology.
    Here, we discuss the function of polymorphism in body color which is one of the
    most conspicuous features of organisms strongly affecting the performance of species.
    We applied a phylogenetic comparative approach to assess whether body color polymorphisms
    contribute to species success in birds, reflected in distributional ranges, extinction
    risk, and current population trends. We compiled and analyzed a comprehensive
    global dataset that included the distribution, phylogeny, ecology and morphological
    traits of all extant bird species. Species with body color polymorphism showed
    larger distributional ranges, larger environmental ranges, lower risk of extinction,
    and more stable population trends. Our analyses suggest that the presence of color
    polymorphism contributes to avian species success at the global scale, especially
    reflected in lower extinction likelihood and better population trends.

  description: Phenotypic evolution is shaped by phylogenetic, ecological and biomechanical
    constraints. Butterfly wings offer an ideal system to explore these constraints
    as their evolution is strongly influenced by natural and sexual selection affecting
    colour patterns and wing shape in relation to visual signalling and flight performance.
    We focus on Eudamina skippers, butterflies with large-scale phenotypic convergences
    involving wing shape and colour pattern. Using a comprehensive morphometric dataset
    encompassing 176 species, we assess their morphological evolution in a phylogenetic
    framework. We show that hindwing tails and dorsal iridescence, proposed to signal
    high escape ability, have repeatedly evolved in tropical species. Hindwing tails
    are associated with intermediate body size, low wing loading and a forewing shape
    that facilitates manoeuvrability; iridescence is more common in large species
    with significantly high wing loading and aspect ratio, indicating high flight
    speed and manoeuvrability. The evolution of all tested morphometric traits is
    best described by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models, indicating stabilising selection
    around fitness optima in Eudamina. Models testing for random drift or early burst
    dynamics were rejected in all cases. We reveal a clear co-evolution between the
    fore- and hindwing shapes, despite both wings having different functional constraints.
    Hindwing tails have a significant recurrent effect on forewing shape in lineages
    evolving them independently, suggesting the existence of evolutionary trade-offs
    between flight performance and antipredator defences. Our study shows that the
    convergent morphologies across Eudamina have likely arisen not by neutral evolution
    but by ecological selection influenced by biomechanical constraints.

    fauna and forest fire risk. In this study, we modelled spatiotemporal variation
    in FMC using optical remote sensing. We inverted the PROSPECT and GEOSAIL Radiative
    Transfer Models (RTM) on Sentinel-2 satellite reflectance data of 20 m ground
    resolution to retrieve FMC, and then predicted FMC at sub-continental scales using
    a random forest (RF) regression emulation of the RTM model. An RTM look-up-table,
    from earlier work, was filtered by ecological criteria from 24 sites sampled along
    precipitation and canopy cover gradients and was inverted by using the spectral
    angle, as a merit function. The RF emulator allowed efficient computation and
    presentation of an extensive and fine-scale forest FMC data cube of interest in
    animal, fire and plant ecology. Our RTM-based, predictions of forest and woodland
    FMC had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.9% of dry matter content and explained
    more than 60% of variance (r2 = 0.62). This represents an improvement over previous
    models using reflectance data of coarser spatial resolution, particularly in terms
    of explained variance (r2=0.17 and RMSE=32%). The emulator model achieved similar
    performance to the RTM with slightly larger error (RMSE = 21.77%) and smaller
    explained variance (r2 = 0.54). Overall, both models performed best in forests,
    and woodlands of moderate to high canopy density (> ~0.75 LAI). This study demonstrates
    that FMC can be monitored at spatial resolutions that allow intra- or inter-landscape
    patterns to be resolved surpassing previous capabilities.

    green algae. Here, we purified photosystem I-LHCI (PSI-LHCI) supercomplexes from
    E. gracilis strain Z and characterized their biochemical and spectroscopic properties.
    The purified complex exhibited a unique pigment profile, notably including diadinoxanthin
    that is typically found in red-lineage organisms, setting E. gracilis apart from
    green-lineage organisms. The absorption spectrum displayed the Qy band of chlorophyll
    a at 675nm, while the 77-K fluorescence-emission spectrum revealed a prominent
    peak at 732nm, closely resembling those in land plants. These features suggest
    that long-wavelength chlorophylls bound to LHCI may be evolutionarily conserved.
    Nevertheless, the absence of neoxanthin, lutein, and violaxanthin further differentiates
    the Euglena LHCIs from other oxyphototrophs. Together, these results illuminate
    the evolutionary diversification of PSI-LHCI supercomplexes and offer insights
    into the unique pigment-binding features of the Euglena light-harvesting system.
